    "reasoning": "### Steps and Reasoning\n\n**Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **1a. Data Integrity:** No credit report was provided (`status`: Not Available), making it impossible to verify the provided applicant data against the credit report. This was flagged as a critical issue since a credit report is essential for underwriting.\n- **1b. Credit Risk:** Not assessed due to the missing credit report.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\nThe proposal’s financial figures appear consistent with the applicant's profile and stated income. No anomalies were noted that would violate the \"smell test.\"\n\n**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **3a. Credit Risk:** The applicant's credit score of 665 falls into Tier B (620–699). A finding was logged for reference.\n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure:**\n  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):**\n    - Calculated LTV is 67.97%, well within the maximum allowable limit of 100% for Tier B customers. A finding was logged confirming compliance.\n  - **Vehicle Criteria:**\n    - Vehicle age at the start of the agreement is 6 years (2025 - 2019). With a 48-month term, the age at the end would be 10 years. This meets the policy requirements of a maximum vehicle age of 8 years at inception and 12 years at term end.\n    - The mileage of 48,024 is far below the maximum allowable 100,000 miles.\n    - No further action is required here.\n  - **3c. Affordability:**\n    - Calculated Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is 8%, which is significantly below the maximum allowable 40% for Tier B customers. This was reported as a finding for compliance.\n\n**Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\nWhile most aspects of the application comply with the policy, the absence of a complete credit report introduces significant risk and prevents thorough underwriting. Although the proposal is strong in terms of affordability and LTV, the inability to assess credit and financial history is critically damaging to the overall risk assessment.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nI have systematically reviewed the proposal and documented all findings. The following issues or compliance checks were crucial:\n1. Missing credit report (Critical issue).\n2. Applicant meets Tier B credit band (Informational/Medium severity for underwriting consideration).\n3. Loan-to-Value ratio of 67.97% (Compliant).\n4. Debt-to-Income ratio of 8% (Far below allowable 40% for Tier B).\n\nGiven the critical absence of the credit report, underwriting cannot proceed reliably unless alternative methods to assess creditworthiness are applied or the report is provided.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
