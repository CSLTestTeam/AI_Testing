    ],
    "reasoning": "## Step-by-Step Triage Analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Data Verification:**\n   - No discrepancies could be checked between `proposalJson` and `creditReportJson` because the credit report was explicitly listed as \"Not Available\".\n\n2. **Critical Finding:** Missing Credit Report Data\n   - This is a severe issue as the applicant's historical creditworthiness and financial risk cannot be assessed. \n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- **Proposal Overview:**\n  - **Vehicle:** 2019 Honda Jazz, priced at £42,757, with mileage at 48,024 miles.\n  - **Applicant's Credit Score:** 618 (Tier C – Sub-Prime).\n  - **Advance Amount:** £27,381 (including £15,376 deposit).\n  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** 2%. Well below the Tier C limit of 35%.\n  - **LTV Ratio:** 67.97%. Well below the Tier C maximum of 95%.\n\n- The proposal signals possible affordability (confirmed low DTI) and adherence of the financial structure, but the missing credit report constitutes a major roadblock. The applicant also falls into Tier C (Sub-Prime) for their low credit score, which mandates further scrutiny.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **3a. Credit Risk:** \n   - The applicant falls into Tier C due to their credit score of 618, which is below the minimum 620 required for Tier B but above the 550 minimum for Tier C. This requires stricter underwriting and affordability checks. **[Medium Severity]**\n\n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure:**\n   - **Vehicle Criteria:**\n      - The vehicle's age at agreement start is 6 years, and it will be 9 years old at the end of the 3-year loan. This adheres to policy requirements (not exceeding 12 years at term end or 8 years at start).\n      - Vehicle mileage is 48,024 miles, which is far below the maximum of 100,000 at agreement start.\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n      - The calculated LTV ratio is 67.97%. This is well under the 95% cap for Tier C applicants. **[Low Severity]**\n   - **Term Length:**\n      - Term length of 36 months (3 years) adheres to policy for a vehicle starting at 6 years of age, as it is below the maximum allowable 48 months.\n\n- **3c. Affordability Assessment (DTI):**\n   - DTI Ratio: Using a £400 proposed instalment and a stated monthly income of £20,292, DTI calculates to **2%**, far below the 35% maximum for Tier C. **[Low Severity]**\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- **Findings Combination:**\n   - The low DTI ratio and LTV percentage mitigate some risk, indicating affordability and financial structure compliance.\n   - However, the missing credit report is a severe risk factor, leaving a gap in the ability to assess the applicant's creditworthiness fully. \n   - Additionally, Tier C credit requires stricter underwriting scrutiny. Given this credit score tier and the missing credit report data, confidence in the applicant's creditworthiness cannot be assessed accurately.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n1. **Critical:** Missing Credit Report Data.\n2. **Medium:** Credit score qualifies for Tier C (Sub-Prime).\n3. **Low:**  LTV Ratio of 67.97% aligns with Tier C policy limits.\n4. **Low:**  DTI of 2% is notably below the Tier C threshold of 35%.\n5. **Neutral Observations:** Vehicle and agreement parameters meet all specified policy criteria (age, mileage, term length).\n\nConcluding the review, the absence of the credit report is deemed a critical blocker for calculating true creditworthiness. The other findings were positive for affordability and structuring but cannot outweigh the severity of the missing report. This proposal cannot proceed further without the missing credit report.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE."
