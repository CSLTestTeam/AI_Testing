    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThe credit report is marked as \"Not Available\". Due to its absence, I flagged this as a critical finding since I cannot verify the applicant's creditworthiness, check for any discrepancies with the provided application data, or examine the applicant's financial health via the credit report.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check (The \"Gut Check\")\nGiven the missing credit report, I will perform a broad review based only on the available data to assess whether the proposed deal makes sense. No major \"red flags\" appear based on the financial data and loan structure:\n\n1. A stated monthly income of $5,292 supports a $400 monthly payment, which is 7.56% of the income before considering other commitments.\n2. The applicant's job position as a \"Technical Lead\" with a high stated income is reasonable.\n3. The vehicle's model, year, and retail price align with this type of application.\n\nDetails of each criterion still need to be verified under Step 3 to comply with company policy.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (The \"Science\")\n#### Step 3a: Credit Risk - Missing Credit Score Verification\nThe applicant's credit score of 665 is provided in the proposal data, but I cannot cross-verify this due to the missing credit report. A credit score check will need to be skipped for now, and the risk associated with this cannot be determined.\n\n#### Step 3b: Asset & Loan Structure\nI will methodically validate the following using the Policy Manual:\n1. **Vehicle Criteria (Age & Mileage)**\n2. **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)**\n3. **Loan Term**\n\nSending requests for relevant policy guidelines and calculated values.### Step 3 (continued): Asset & Loan Structure Evaluation\nBased on the provided proposal data and policy documentation retrieved, here is the updated evaluation:\n\n1. **Maximum Vehicle Age and Mileage:**\n   - The age of the vehicle is calculated as **2025 - 2019 = 6 years** at loan initiation.\n   - The loan term of 48 months is within policy maximums, as it results in a vehicle age of **10 years** at loan's end (**12 years max**).\n   - The proposed vehicle mileage of **48,024 miles** is well below the policy's maximum allowable mileage of **100,000 miles** at start.\n     \n   **No issues found.**\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):**\n   - The calculated LTV is **67.97%**, which comfortably falls below the maximum allowed for a Tier B applicant (100%). It aligns with policy.\n\n   **No issues related to LTV were found.**\n\n3. **Loan Term Length:**\n   - The term length of **48 months (4 years)** does not exceed the maximum allowable period for this application (60 months for younger vehicles, or 48 months for vehicles over 5 years old).\n    \n   **No issues found.**\n\nNext, I will assess the affordability based on the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining all findings:\n1. The **missing credit report** is a major critical issue, severely limiting the assessment of the applicant's financial risk profile.\n2. Both the **LTV ratio** and vehicle age and mileage comply with the policy's maximum limits for likely Tier B applicants.\n3. The Debt-to-Income (DTI): calculations reaches cruciality dependantptions"
