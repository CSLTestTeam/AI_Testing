Score: 0.9000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output correctly identifies key findings from the input, such as the unrealistic stated income, high LTV ratio, and flags the critical issue of missing credit report as instructed (which should not be penalized per evaluation steps). The output provides accurate reasoning for each triage flag and references relevant policy sections. However, it misses flagging the vehicle age violation, which is a required and critical finding given the vehicle will be 13 years old at loan end, exceeding the 12-year policy maximum. Otherwise, the output is faithful and thorough with no hallucinations except for the expected credit report mention.
