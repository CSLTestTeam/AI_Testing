Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response is generally faithful in its findings and reasoning except for a major hallucination: it repeatedly reports a missing credit report as a critical issue, when one is in fact present in the input. Other findings such as the credit score tier, LTV, DTI, term length, and vehicle age are correctly calculated and match policy requirements without error. The analysis is otherwise logical and well-constructed, and there are no unsupported claims or contradictions beyond the handling of the credit report. Per evaluation steps, the persistent flagging and consequences of the missing credit report are not penalised, but the response demonstrates a significant misreading of available data, impacting overall faithfulness.
