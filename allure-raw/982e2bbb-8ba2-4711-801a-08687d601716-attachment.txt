Score: 0.4000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies and analyzes several policy criteria such as credit tier, DTI, LTV, and vehicle eligibility, and avoids hallucinations except for the missed credit report issue (which should not be penalized). However, it fails to flag the key policy violation that the proposed term length of 60 months exceeds the 48-month maximum for vehicles older than 5 years, which is expected per the input. This omission reduces its faithfulness to the input and expected output.
