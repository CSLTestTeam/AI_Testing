    ],
    "reasoning": "### Summary of Analysis and Findings\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **Critical Issue Identified**: The credit report is missing.\n  - This was flagged as a critical finding since it prevents the underwriting process from assessing creditworthiness and ensuring compliance with policy.\n  \n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- The loan appears plausible for the applicant's stated income and the vehicle's value. There are no obvious inconsistencies that fail the \"smell test\". However, further checks were crucial for risk evaluation.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n1. **Credit Risk**:\n   - The applicant's credit score of 600 falls into **Tier C** based on company policy, indicating the need for stricter lending criteria.\n   - Policy mandates that individuals under Tier C might be subjected to adjustments, such as a minimum deposit.\n   - **Findings Reported: Medium severity violation due to Tier B minimum score mismatch**.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n   - The calculated LTV is 67.97%, well below the maximum of 95% allowed for Tier C applicants. No policy breach here.\n   - **Findings Reported: Low severity, LTV confirmed as acceptable within policy**.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**:\n   - Calculated DTI is only 2%, far below the 35% cap for Tier C applicants. This signifies excellent affordability.\n   - **Findings Reported: Low severity, DTI deemed acceptable**.\n\n4. **Vehicle and Term Policy**:\n   - The vehicle is 5 years old, and the agreement’s 60-month term would keep it within the acceptable range (12 years) at the end of the term.\n   - Vehicle mileage (48,024) is also compliant with the maximum 100,000 miles allowed.\n   - **Findings Reported: Compliance confirmed; low-tier note added for thoroughness**.\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- The lack of a credit report presents a significant gap as it disallows full verification of the applicant’s financial behavior.\n- Credit score (600) positions the applicant in Tier C, whose stricter terms are justified to offset risk.\n- While affordability is evidently strong (low DTI and LTV), reliance on stringent Tier C terms is recommended due to the score-based categorization.\n\n#### Final Observations:\n1. The applicant currently satisfies most key policies except for some high-risk Tier C triggers.\n2. **Critical Action**: A credit report must be secured as it fundamentally informs the overall decision-making.\n3. **Recommendations**:\n   - Proceed only after meeting Tier C conditions like minimum deposit compliance and confirming no other derogative financial behavior through a retrieved credit report.\n   - With the 67.97% LTV and 2% DTI already well-aligned to policy, consider approval once the credit report gap closes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll findings have been thoroughly reported, and the underwriting team is encouraged to revisit the case after the credit report availability issue is resolved.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
