    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Data Verification and Credit Report**: The credit report data was noted as unavailable. This is a Critical issue since the inability to perform a credit report review eliminates critical insights into past financial behavior and trustworthiness.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The applicant's stated monthly income appears unusually high, possibly warranting verification with actual income documentation as per the policy. This could only be verified through the unavailable credit report.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n#### 3a. Credit Risk:\n1. **Credit Tier Evaluation**: Based on the applicant's score of 560, they fall into Tier C (Sub-Prime). Stricter lending criteria apply, as per policy section 2.1.\n2. **DTI Ratio**: The applicant's calculated DTI is 35.69%, exceeding the Tier C maximum threshold (35%). This is a Medium finding, signaling a potential affordability issue. \n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure:\n3. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: The calculated LTV is 67.97%, which complies with the Tier C maximum threshold of 95%. No action needed here.\n4. **Vehicle Age**: At the end of the loan term, the vehicle will be six years old, well within the maximum allowable threshold of 12 years. No action needed here.\n5. **Vehicle Mileage**: The vehicle mileage of 48,024 is well below the 100,000 limit. No action needed here.\n6. **Loan Term**: The proposed term of 36 months is within the 60 months ceiling for such applications. No risk identified.\n7. **Minimum Deposit**: The mandatory deposit for Tier C applicants is 10% of Goods Cost. The actual deposit made significantly exceeds this requirement, which is positive.\n\n#### 3c. Affordability:\nWithout a credit report, no detailed insights into the applicant's commitments are available. This lack significantly impairs the overall affordability assessment.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- While asset and loan structure criteria are largely met, the Critical issue of no credit report severely inhibits an accurate risk assessment. Combining this with the DTI ratio breach (35.69%) compounds the risk exposure. \n- The exceptionally high stated monthly income suggests a need for further verification. Adequate documentation is necessary.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe systematic review unveiled one Critical issue (no credit report dataâ€”deal-breaker for now), several Medium severity findings for credit risk and income validation, and identified multiple compliant areas (vehicle attributes, term, deposit). The absence of the credit report obstructs complete due diligence.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
