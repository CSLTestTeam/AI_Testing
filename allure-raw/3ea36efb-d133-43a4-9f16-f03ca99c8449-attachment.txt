Score: 0.9000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies excessive vehicle mileage as a high severity risk, aligning with the expected output. It references the vehicle having 148,024 miles (well over the 100,000 policy maximum), and notes this poses significant residual value risk. No hallucinations are present except for the ignored credit report issue. Further, all other findings align with the input parameters, and there is no made-up information. The only minor shortcoming is a lack of expanded discussion about how mileage specifically impacts probable asset depreciation, but this does not detract from the core alignment.
