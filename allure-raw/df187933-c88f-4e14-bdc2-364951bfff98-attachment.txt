Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output fails to follow the retrieval context in several significant ways. It incorrectly flags the absence of a credit report as a critical issue and does not perform the required comparison between proposal and credit report for data integrity, missing all required discrepancy checks. It overlooks necessary credit report analysis, such as negative factors, recent payment history, hard search counts, and fraud markers, neglecting step 1 compliance. The output reports LTV and DTI findings correctly aligned with policy, but overall, it skips most policy checks (e.g., applicant credit tier validation, deposit verification, vehicle age/mileage/term checks). No false mismatches are highlighted, but the response is incomplete and does not cover all required steps or findings from the retrieval context, except for some financial checks.
