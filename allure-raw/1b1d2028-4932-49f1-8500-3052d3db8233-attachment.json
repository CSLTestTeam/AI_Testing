This is a critical issue as it prevents a full credit risk and financial validation.\n- _Critical finding_ has been reported.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n1. Basic reasonability checks:\n   - Applicant's stated monthly income seems abnormally high for a \"Technical Lead\" role at £20,292 per month.\n   - Additional investigation or verification of income is necessary.\n\n> **Action**: No action reported, but income discrepancy noted internally for underwriter review given unusual income discrepancy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n1. **Credit Tiers**:\n    - Applicant's credit score is 599, which falls into Tier C (Sub-Prime) range according to Section 2.1 of the policy manual.\n    - A stricter underwriting process is required, and a minimum cash deposit of 10% is mandatory.\n    - Relevant finding flagged with medium severity.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n    - The calculated LTV is 67.97%, which is well within the 95% maximum allowed for Tier C applicants per Section 4.1.\n    - Finding flagged with low severity for internal considerations.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**:\n    - Debt-to-Income ratio has been calculated as 2%. Given the Tier C maximum allowable DTI of 35%, this is well within limits.\n    - Finding flagged with low severity.\n\n4. **Vehicle Criteria**:\n    - Vehicle is a 2019 Honda Jazz with current mileage of 48,024.\n    - Maximum age of vehicle at term completion will be 9 years, which is within the 12-year maximum as per Section 4.2.\n    - No issues identified here.\n\n5. **Term Length**:\n    - Loan term is 36 months. In compliance with policy restrictions.\n\n6. **Minimum Deposit**:\n    - Customer total deposit stands at £70, falling significantly short of the prescribed minimum of 10% (approx. £4,275.70). As per Section 4.4, Tier C mandates this threshold is met.\n    - _Significant Gap identified_ under bad Causes by absence validation reasons.requires--rejected.Setup.docs"
