Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output contains several hallucinations, most notably the critical flag for a missing credit report and associated reasoning, even though the input provides a complete credit report. This key error undermines the faithfulness of the findings. Although some policy checks such as credit score tier, LTV, DTI, deposit minimum, and vehicle eligibility are accurately referenced and match the input data, the repeated assertion of a missing credit report and its consequences are fabricated. All other details are consistent and policy-aligned, but the main hallucination prevents strong alignment.
