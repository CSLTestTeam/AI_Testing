Score: 0.9000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output is faithful to the input and reports findings grounded in the proposal and policy context. It correctly identifies the applicant's credit score as Tier C, calculates and flags the appropriate DTI and LTV values, notes the lack of minimum deposit, and correctly describes the vehicle and term length as compliant. There are no hallucinations except for reporting the credit report as missing, which should be ignored per the evaluation instructions. However, the reasoning for the deposit finding refers to 'bad Causes by absence validation reasons.requires--rejected.Setup.docs', which is awkward and possibly generated text not accounted for in the input or context, slightly affecting alignment.
