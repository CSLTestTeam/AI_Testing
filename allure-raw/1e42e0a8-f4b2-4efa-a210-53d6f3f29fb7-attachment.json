    "reasoning": "### Summary of Steps Taken:\n\n**Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- Skipped as no credit report was provided. Reported this as a critical finding.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- Reviewed core figures such as income, vehicle cost, and loan amount. No significant inconsistencies were noted at this stage.\n\n**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **Credit Risk:** Cross-checked the applicant's credit score (618) using policy for \"Credit Tiers\". Determined the applicant is in Credit Tier C due to a score below the minimum threshold for Tier B (620+). Reported as a medium severity issue and flagged for stricter criteria to be applied.\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Calculated LTV with the provided `advance` and `tradePrice` to find an LTV ratio of 67.97%. Confirmed the policy's maximum LTV limit for Tier C is 95%, hence noted this as a low-risk factor.\n- **Affordability (DTI):** Calculated the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio as 2%. Verified the DTI against the maximum allowable (35% for Tier C). Found the DTI is extremely low, which suggests high affordability and is a positive indicator.\n\n**Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- The applicant meets Tier C requirements for LTV and DTI but falls short for Tier B credit score requirements. The lack of a credit report is a significant concern as it removes the ability to assess default history and validate repayment ability.\n- While LTV and DTI are favorable, all findings point to Tier C credit restrictions due to the score. Strict underwriting must now apply.\n\n### Final Findings and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Critical:** Credit report not provided. Deal should be declined unless a complete credit report is submitted for review.\n2. **Medium:** Credit score falls into Tier C. This requires evaluation with stricter lending criteria such as adhering to Tier C affordability, LTV, and deposit terms.\n3. **Low (Positive):** LTV is significantly below the maximum permitted for Tier C. This is indicative of low financial risk concerning the vehicle financing.\n4. **Low (Positive):** DTI is well below the allowable maximum for Tier C, showing strong affordability for the applicant.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll findings have been thoroughly assessed and recorded. The missing credit report is a critical blocker. With the provided information, the proposal is unlikely to proceed without the required document to complete the assessment. TRIAGE_COMPLETE."
