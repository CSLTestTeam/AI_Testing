Score: 0.9000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response accurately identifies the vehicle's mileage as 148,024 miles, far exceeding the stated policy maximum of 100,000 miles, and correctly flags this as a high-severity issue and a deal-breaker for eligibility. This aligns very closely with the expected output, which anticipated the identification of high mileage as a significant risk. The response is detailed, correct, and references the policy section governing mileage limits. There are no hallucinations aside from the mention of a missing credit report, which is not to be penalized. The only minor shortcoming is that the summary does not clearly mention, in brief, that high mileage alone is a risk (it pairs it with the credit report issue in the final recommendation), but this is a minor clarity point and does not significantly detract from the overall faithfulness.
