Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output correctly identifies and reports, with clear reasoning, the vehicle's age violationâ€”highlighting that it is 10 years old and thus exceeds the 8-year maximum allowed at the start of the agreement, fully aligning with the expected output. Other details, such as credit score, LTV ratio, and overall process work, are broadly faithful to the input and policy context without fabrication, besides the critical flag about a missing credit report (which should not be penalized). However, the response includes unrelated findings (e.g., LTV ratio and credit score flags) not mentioned in the expected output, which slightly reduces alignment but does not introduce any clear hallucinations.
