    "reasoning": "### Summary of Analysis and Findings:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- The credit report is entirely missing. This is a critical issue as no financial health analysis, credit account history review, or fraud check could be conducted. This was reported as a critical finding.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The proposal suggests a high-income applicant seeking financing for a relatively expensive vehicle, with a significant deposit and a manageable monthly instalment. No gut-check red flags were found regarding reasonableness of the deal.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **Credit Risk (Applicant Credit Score and Tier)**:\n  - Applicant has a credit score of 619, which places them at Tier C (Sub-prime), requiring stricter lending criteria.\n\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Analysis**:\n  - **LTV Calculated**: 67.97%.\n  - **Policy Limit**: Max 95% LTV for Tier C applicants.\n  - Observation: The LTV is within the acceptable limit for Tier C. A finding was reported to confirm alignment and note suitability.\n\n- **Vehicle Criteria Compliance**:\n  - Vehicle’s age is 4 years old currently. At the end of the 72-month loan agreement, the vehicle will be 10 years old, which meets the maximum 12-year limit.\n  - Mileage of the vehicle starts at 48,024, which is under the 100,000-mile maximum. No issue detected.\n\n- **Loan Term Validation**:\n  - The loan term is 72 months. Policy states a maximum term of 60 months, or 48 months if the vehicle age at the start of the agreement exceeds 5 years. As the vehicle will be over 5 years old when the loan starts, the loan term violates both criteria.\n  - A \"High\" severity finding was reported for this violation.\n\n- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Analysis**:\n  - **DTI Calculated**: 2%.\n  - **Policy Limit**: 35% maximum for Tier C applicants.\n  - Observation: DTI is well within the allowable limit, indicating affordable monthly commitments compared to income. A \"Low\" finding was reported to support alignment with policy.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The missing credit report poses a severe obstacle to holistic analysis. While individual aspects of affordability and LTV are compliant, the term length mismatch for vehicle age also signals elevated risk. The combination of these findings heightens the overall risk profile.\n\n#### Final Recommendations:\n- Obtain the applicant’s full credit report to assess creditworthiness, financial history, and mitigative factors such as negative information, fraud indicators, and hard searches.\n- Initiate dialogue with the applicant to adjust the loan terms to comply with policy parameters, particularly regarding the 60-month total maximum loan term or 48-month limit for vehicles over 5 years old.\n  \nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
