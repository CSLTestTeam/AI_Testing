Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output generally follows the evaluation steps, accurately flagging policy-relevant details: the credit score classification, DTI, LTV, and the risk of the vehicle age reaching the maximum allowable limit at agreement end. However, it incorrectly reports the vehicle age issue as compliant (maximum age 'at end' is 12 years, and the vehicle will be exactly 12 at term end; policy allows 'up to', not 'equals or exceeds'). It misses the core expected output detail: specifically highlighting that the vehicle age exceeds, not just meets, the maximum allowed age, which is a subtle but important distinction per the expected output. No unrelated hallucinations are present.
