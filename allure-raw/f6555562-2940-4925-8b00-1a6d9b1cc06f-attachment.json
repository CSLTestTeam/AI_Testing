    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThis step was skipped per instructions because the credit report was not provided. A critical finding was already reported regarding this.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe data provided rises to meet \"sanity\" expectations based on the accurate, consistent financial data and logical loan requests. The applicant, with a near-prime credit score (665, Tier B) and moderate income (£5,292 monthly), is seeking a reasonable vehicle loan (£27,381 advance) for a standard Honda Jazz priced at £42,757. The LTV and DTI also appear manageable and within normal policy expectations. There are no evident red flags upon this initial evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk (Policy Section 2.1)**\n   - Credit Score is 665, corresponding to Tier B (eligible for standard terms). \n   - **Policy compliance:** Confirmed. (Reported as \"Low Severity Credit Score Placement\" finding).\n\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure (Policy Section 4.0)**\n   a. **LTV Compliance**\n      - Calculated LTV: **67.97%**\n      - Maximum permissible LTV for Tier B: **100%**\n      - **Policy compliance:** Confirmed. Reported as a low-severity finding due to positive compliance.\n   b. **Vehicle Age at Start and End of Loan**\n      - Age at start of loan: 6 years\n      - Age at end of loan (48-month term): 10 years\n      - Eligibility: Max start age = 8 years, Max end age = 12 years\n      - **Policy compliance:** Confirmed for both start and end ages (Findings reported as low-severity).\n   c. **Term Length**\n      - Loan term: 48 months (4 years)\n      - For vehicles over 5 years old, max term allowed is 48 months\n      - **Policy compliance:** Confirmed (Finding reported as compliant)\n\n3. **Affordability (Policy Section 3.0)**\n   a. **DTI Compliance (Policy Section 3.1)**\n      - Calculated DTI: **8%**\n      - Allowable DTI for Tier B: **<=40%**\n      - **Policy compliance:** Confirmed. Reported as a low-severity finding for positive compliance.\n   b. **Income Verification**\n      - The stated income of £5,292 has not been validated via supporting documentation (e.g., payslip). Per policy, use of the applicant's documents should occur before final approval.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nDespite a lack of a credit report, the proposal aligns with all extracted policy guidelines for LTV, DTI, vehicle characteristics, and loan term; no individual risks escalate when assessed in combination.\n\nSummary of the Findings:\n- LTV and DTI ratios comply and remain well below thresholds for Tier B applicants.\n- The vehicle age and terms are within the limits prescribed by policy.\n- The lack of a credit report remains the most critical gap, making creditworthiness unverifiable.\n  \n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Review\nThe next underwriter must proceed only after obtaining and reviewing the missed credit report. Beyond this omission, no disqualifying risks were discovered, but meticulous income validation should occur upon review resumption.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
