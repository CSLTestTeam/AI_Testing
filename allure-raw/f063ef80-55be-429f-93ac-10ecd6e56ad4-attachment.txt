Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output mostly aligns with the proposal data and policies: credit score, vehicle age, mileage, LTV, and DTI are all correctly calculated and flagged according to Tier B and policy limits, matching the input. However, there are some duplication and inconsistencies in flag reporting: LTV is flagged both as over the limit (Medium severity, 'LTV Exceeds Tier B Maximum') and as within the limit (Low severity), which contradicts itself since calculated LTV (67.97%) is well within the Tier B max (100%). Vehicle age at term end is slightly inconsistently described (8, 10 years) though all are valid within the policy. No unsupported claims or fabricated issues, apart from the expected credit report absence flag, and calculations are accurate, but contradiction in LTV flags is a clear logical flaw.
