    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Credit Report Missing:**\n   - As no credit report was provided for this proposal, I was unable to validate critical details such as `Applicant.LastName`, `Applicant.DateOfBirth`, `Applicant.CurrentAddress.Postcode`, or analyze their credit risk further. This is a critical issue as no credit checks could be performed. \n\n   **Reported Finding:** Credit report missing.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Based solely on available data:\n  - Vehicle: The vehicle's retail price is £42,757, and the applicant is seeking financing for £27,381 after providing a significant deposit of £15,376 (including part exchange). The large deposit suggests some level of creditworthiness or pre-emptive mitigation for risk.\n  - The potential cash flow demand is minimal, as the monthly instalment (£400) constitutes a very low Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 2%. \n  - Overall, while certain factors raise red flags, such as the missing credit report, other factors such as the sizable deposit indicate some level of financial prudence.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification \n1. **Credit Risk Verification**  \n   - Policy specifies that a Tier C credit score starts at **620**. The applicant's **credit score of 619** narrowly misses this threshold.  \n   **Reported Finding:** A medium-severity violation of Credit Tier C's minimum requirement.  \n\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure Verification**\n   - Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV): I used the Financial Calculator to calculate the LTV as approximately **67.97%**. This is well below the **maximum 95%** for Tier C and is compliant with policy. However, since we may already be exceeding other thresholds, additional scrutiny is advised.  \n   - Maximum Loan Term for Vehicle Age: Policy requires vehicles older than 5 years at purchase to have a **max term of 48 months**.  \n     - The **Honda Jazz** (2019 model) will be 10 years old at the end of the proposed 6-year term (72 months), violating the maximum age of 12 years.  \n     **Reported Finding:** A critical violation of allowable term limits for the provided vehicle.  \n\n3. **Affordability Verification**\n   - I used the Financial Calculator tool to calculate DTI. The result was **2%**, well below the maximum 35% threshold defined for Tier C applicants in Policy Section 3.1.  \n     **Reported Finding:** A low-severity finding indicating the DTI ratio is significantly within limits, which supports the applicant's affordability.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- Despite a significant deposit (indicative of financial grounding) and a commendable DTI ratio, there are multiple issues, most notably the absence of a credit report and the loan's non-compliance with vehicle age and term rules. \n- Additionally, while the applicant narrowly misses the Tier C credit score requirement by just 1 point, this may also necessitate stricter terms or reduction of risk to mitigate perceived vulnerabilities.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nHaving completed the analysis, the following points summarize my findings for the underwriter:\n1. **Critical Issue:** Missing credit report. High-severity risk as no creditworthiness assessment can be conducted for this applicant. Immediate grounds for declining the application.\n2. **Medium Issue:** The applicant’s credit score falls narrowly below Tier C requirements (619 versus 620), potentially necessitating a higher deposit or stricter terms.\n3. **Critical Issue:** Loan term of 72 months is too long for the 2019 Honda Jazz, as it exceeds the allowable age limit at the end of the term.\n4. **Low Issue:** The Debt-to-Income ratio is well within acceptable thresholds at only 2%.\n\nThe combination of no credit report and the exceeded vehicle age for the proposed term are particularly significant issues. In the absence of the necessary credit report for verification, the proposal cannot proceed. Additionally, even if the credit report were available, the vehicle age and term issue would still constitute a significant barrier to approval.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
