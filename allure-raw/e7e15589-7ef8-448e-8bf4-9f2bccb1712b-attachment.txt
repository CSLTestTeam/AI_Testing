Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output is mostly faithful and thoroughly covers the proposal assessment, including all major findings and accurate policy references. It correctly highlights credit score tier, LTV, DTI, and vehicle policy compliance, and does not penalize the missing credit report per instructions. However, it fails to mention the expected high number of recent credit searches found in the input's credit report search history. This omission is significant since the expected output calls for flagging this risk, which is part of the model's triage responsibilities. No hallucinations or invented findings are present, but the critical omission results in a moderate penalty.
