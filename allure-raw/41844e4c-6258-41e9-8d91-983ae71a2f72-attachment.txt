Score: 0.9000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output faithfully reviews the proposal and systematically flags all core findings relevant to the input data, such as correct credit tier identification (Tier B for score 665), accurate calculation of LTV (67.97% using advance/trade price), accurate DTI ratio (8% using total monthly commitments and stated income), and proper vehicle age checks against policy limits (correctly identifying ages at start and end of agreement). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims except for the flag regarding the absence of the credit report, which is to be ignored as per the evaluation steps. The reasoning is detailed and logically consistent with both input data and policy context. No calculation errors or contradictions were found. The only minor shortcoming is repeating emphasis on missing credit data despite its presence, but this does not impact the score as instructed.
