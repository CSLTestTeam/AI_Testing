Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output provides several triage flags with relevant details, and generally aligns each issue with specific target fields, severities, and reasoning, mostly following the structure described in the retrieval context for triage findings. It correctly covers key underwriting criteria such as credit score, deposit, loan-to-value, DTI, and vehicle age/mileage. However, it incorrectly flags a missing credit report as 'Critical', despite a full credit report being available in the input. This constitutes a false mismatch as per the evaluation steps. The synthesis summary is somewhat disorganized and fails to reference all required policy searches or thoroughly document each step, which weakens explainability and systematic reporting. These shortcomings warrant a penalty for not precisely following the retrieval context and highlighting a major false mismatch.
