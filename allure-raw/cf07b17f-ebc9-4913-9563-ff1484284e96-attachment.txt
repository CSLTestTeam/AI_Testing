Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output accurately identifies the applicant's credit score as qualifying for Tier C and references relevant policy sections, and correctly flags the LTV as within Tier C limits. However, it fails to mention that the cash deposit (only 20, far less than 10% of the goods cost, which should be 4275.70) is below the minimum required for Tier C applicants as specified in policy section 4.4. There are no hallucinations except the missing credit report flag, which is to be ignored. Overall, the response aligns well with input data but lacks one critical policy finding.
