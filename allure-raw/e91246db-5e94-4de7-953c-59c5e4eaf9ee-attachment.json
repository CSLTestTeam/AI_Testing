    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n\nThe credit report is entirely unavailable, based on the information provided in the credit report JSON. Therefore, I have flagged this as a critical issue since the lack of the credit report impairs the ability to analyze the applicant's financial health.\n\n**Findings:**\n- Reported the absence of the credit report as a critical issue.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nEven without a credit report, I reviewed the proposal data briefly to determine if there are any glaring anomalies.\n\n1. **Income & Monthly Instalment Relation:**\n   - Applicant's stated monthly income is £20,292, and the proposed monthly instalment is £400. The monthly instalment forms a small fraction (1.97%) of the applicant's income, which would usually seem reasonable if income reporting and data were verified.\n   \n2. **Loan Advance vs Deposits:**\n   - The loan advance amount of £27,381 aligns with the stated cost of the goods (£42,757) minus the cash and part exchange deposits (£15,376 in total). No inconsistencies were identified here.\n\n3. **Employment Details:**\n   - Applicant has been employed for only 7 months, which could indicate potential instability in job tenure.\n\n**Preliminary Observations:**\nWhile income and loan figures seem valid on the surface, the following concerns arise:\n- Insufficient employment tenure (7 months), which may present a risk.\n- The inability to verify income or review past credit behavior due to the missing credit report.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nSkipping policy verification of the credit score due to absence of the credit report. However, I will continue checking non-credit-related policy areas.\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk: Applicant's Credit Score\nAs credit score is extracted from the missing report, this aspect cannot be analyzed. This limitation has already been noted as a critical issue.\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure\nI will now calculate the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and check policies for vehicle age, loan term, and other relevant criteria.\n\nExecuting necessary calculations and policy searches...### Detailed Policy Verification Results:\n\n#### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Calculation:\n1. **LTV Calculation Result:** LTV = (Total Advance £27,381 / Vehicle Trade Price £40,283) * 100 = 67.97%.\n2. **Policy Threshold for Tier C Applicants:** Maximum allowable LTV is **95%**, based on the \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\" section of the policy.\n\n- **Finding:** The LTV of 67.97% is within policy limits.\n\n#### Vehicle Age and Loan Term:\n1. **Vehicle Age at Start:** The vehicle is from the year 2021. Considering the proposal is in 2025, the vehicle is **4 years old**, which complies with the policy (maximum age at the start of the agreement is 8 years).\n2. **Vehicle Age at End:** The loan's requested duration is 60 months (5 years). At the end of the term, the vehicle will be **9 years old**, which is within the maximum limit of 12 years as per policy guidelines.\n3. **Loan Term Compliance:** The maximum allowable loan term is 60 months for vehicles younger than 5 years. The proposed term of 60 months adheres to the policy.\n\n- **Finding:** Both the vehicle's age and the loan term are compliant with the policy.\n\n#### Minimum Deposit:\n1. Per \"Section 4.4\" of the policy manual, applicants in **Credit Tier C** must provide a cash deposit of at least **10% of the Goods Cost**. The Goods Cost is £42,757, and the cash deposit provided is £5,226.\n   \n   Minimum deposit required = 10% of £42,757 = **£4,275.70**.\n   Stated deposit = **£5,226**.\n\n- **Finding:** The applicant meets the minimum deposit requirement, and this aspect complies with the policy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n1. **Successes:**\n   - The LTV, vehicle age, loan term, and deposit requirements are all compliant with the policy.\n2. **Concerns:**\n   - The credit report is not available, resulting in a critical issue. Without it, there's no assessment of creditworthiness, credit history stability, or verification of the credit score and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio compliance.\n   - Employment tenure is only 7 months, indicating potential instability in income sources, but without income verification documents, this cannot be verified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Your Review\n**Findings Summary:**\n1. **Critical:**\n   - The credit report is missing, preventing a proper review of the applicant's creditworthiness, credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio.\n   - Recommendation: Reject the proposal or request resubmission with a valid credit report.\n2. **Low:**\n   - Employment history is short (7 months), which might pose future income continuity risks.\n   - Recommendation: Verify employment history and income with appropriate documents.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the missing credit report, this proposal cannot proceed without further action. All other aspects of the proposal (LTV, vehicle age, loan term, deposit) comply with the company's policy, but the primary issue revolves around the absence of essential credit risk data.\n\nThe evaluation is **complete**, and the proposal should be either rejected or placed on hold for resubmission.\n\n**Conclusion: TRIAGE_COMPLETE.**"
