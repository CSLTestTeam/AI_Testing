    "reasoning": "## Explanation of Steps Taken\n\n### 1. Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- Step 1a (Data Integrity Check): Skipped, as the credit report was not provided.\n- Step 1b (Credit Analysis): Skipped, as the credit report was marked \"Not Available.\"\n\nA **Critical Finding** was raised due to the missing credit report, highlighting the inability to perform a complete risk assessment in the absence of this critical information.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Initial Sanity Check\n- The application shows an applicant with a **Credit Score of 619** (Tier C classification), a stated monthly income of £20,292, and is applying for a £27,381 loan.\n- The vehicle is a 2019 Honda Jazz, with a retail price of £42,757 and trade price of £40,283. These figures suggest the vehicle is on the higher end of pricing for the Honda Jazz model. The purchase does not outright fail the \"smell test\" but does raise slight concerns due to the applicant's credit tier and the vehicle being relatively expensive.\n- No additional findings were reported in this step.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Detailed Policy Verification\n3a: **Credit Risk**\n- Found that the applicant's **Credit Score (619)** falls in the Tier C band as per the Credit Tiers policy (550–619). This rating is one point below Tier B (620–699).\n- Raised a **Medium Finding** to indicate that the applicant is in Tier C and requires stricter scrutiny.\n\n3b: **Asset & Loan Structure**\n- Loan-to-Value ratio was calculated at **67.97%**, which is well within the **95% LTV limit** for Tier C applicants (Policy Section 4.1). \n- No issue identified here, but a finding was raised to confirm compliance for transparency.\n\n- Vehicle Age: The vehicle's **age at agreement start is 6 years (2025-2019)**. The **age at agreement end will be 12 years (6 years + 6-year loan term)**. While meeting the maximum age at the start of the agreement (**8 years max**), the vehicle violates the **end of agreement maximum age policy (12 years max)** since it reaches this limit exactly.\n- Loan Term: The proposal has a **72-month term**, but the Policy Section 4.3 restricts maximum terms to **60 months** for all vehicles. This is a **Critical Finding**, necessitating adjustment of the term.\n\n3c: **Affordability Assessment**\n- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio was calculated at **2%**, which is well within the allowable threshold for Tier C applicants (**35% max as per Policy Section 3.1**).\n- No affordability issues were identified.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Holistic Synthesis\n- The combination of a borderline credit score (Tier C), the missing credit report, and the policy violation regarding the loan term collectively elevate risk significantly.\n- A lower-severity issue (credit score of 619, barely Tier C) becomes more worrisome in light of a potentially non-verifiable application, high-value vehicle, and rule-breaking term.\n- This synthesis highlights a high overall risk but does not warrant additional findings beyond those already raised.\n\n---\n\n## Findings Summary\n1. **Critical: Missing Credit Report Data**\n   - Essential for creditworthiness assessment.\n  \n2. **Medium: Credit Score of 619**\n   - Applicant is Tier C, falling marginally short of Tier B.\n\n3. **Medium: Loan-to-Value Compliance**\n   - LTV ratio (67.97%) is within the acceptable range for Tier C applicants.\n\n4. **Critical: Loan Term Violation**\n   - Exceeds the maximum term of 60 months; this needs mandatory correction.\n\n---\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
