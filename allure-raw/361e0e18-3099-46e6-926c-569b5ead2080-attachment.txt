Score: 0.4000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response identifies the applicant's credit score as being in Tier C and references stricter requirements for this tier, including mentioning a minimum deposit requirement in the reasoning section. However, it fails to correctly report or flag the actual policy violation: the 'cashDeposit' provided (20) is significantly below the required 10% of the Goods Cost (4275.70), which should be a Medium or High severity issue. The absence of this explicit flag for the deposit shortfall means a key expected finding is missing. The output otherwise accurately aligns with policy for credit score and LTV analysis, and there are no hallucinated findings.
