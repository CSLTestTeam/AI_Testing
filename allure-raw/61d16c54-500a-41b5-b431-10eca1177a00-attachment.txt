Reasoning: The actual output faithfully reports the vehicle age exceeds policy limits, which aligns with the explicit requirement to highlight this violation. It correctly details the vehicle's age (10 years) versus the policy maximum (8 years) and provides accurate reasoning and recommendations. All other findings—such as LTV and credit score—are also aligned with input data and policy rules, with no hallucinated content except for the (ignored) mention of a missing credit report. Minor deductions are made as the reasoning section does not clearly conclude with the expected phrase and misses more explicit referencing of the specific policy section for vehicle age per instructions.
