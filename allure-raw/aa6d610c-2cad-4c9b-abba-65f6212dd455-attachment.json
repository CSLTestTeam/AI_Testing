    "reasoning": "### Comprehensive Findings Summary\n\n**Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **Finding: Missing Credit Report (Critical)**\n    - No credit report was available in the data, making it impossible to assess the applicant's financial health or creditworthiness. A credit report is a mandatory requirement, as specified in underwriting guidelines, and its absence constitutes a critical finding. It is highly recommended to decline the deal or request a full credit report to proceed further.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- Based on limited data and without a credit report, there were no significant immediate discrepancies or \"red flags\" concerning the vehicle or proposed terms that necessitated reporting aside from the absence of the credit report. \n\n**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **Credit Risk:** \n    - The applicant's credit score (574) places them in Credit Tier C (sub-prime), which demands stricter criteria. Recommendation: Enforce stricter lending terms.\n    - *Severity: Medium.* Reported.\n- **Loan-to-Value Ratio:** \n    - The calculated LTV is 67.97%, which is within the acceptable range of ≤95% for Tier C applicants.\n    - *Finding logged as Low for completeness even though it complies with policy.* No actionable recommendations required.\n- **Deposit Minimum:**\n    - For Credit Tier C, the policy requires a minimum cash deposit of at least 10% of the vehicle's cost ($4,276 minimum for a Goods Cost of $42,757). Though the offered cash deposit is $5,226 (12.2%) and meets policy,  combined known risky indicators raises mid-severity to evaluate again* finding compliance.\nSince data check `Critical failure `"
