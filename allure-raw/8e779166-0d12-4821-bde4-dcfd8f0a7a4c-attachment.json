    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n\n#### Step 1a: Data Verification\nThis step required verifying the provided proposal against the credit report. However, no credit report is available as indicated by the `creditReportJson`. This is a critical issue since it inhibits the ability to verify core elements such as the applicant's credit score and financial behavior. \n\n#### Step 1b: Analyze Credit Risk\nSince the credit report is missing, credit analysis cannot be performed. Thus, critical information such as defaults, hard searches, or credit utilization is unavailable. Without this data, assessing the applicant's financial health is not possible.\n\nI have reported this as a critical finding. Moving on to step 2 for a basic review of the proposal.\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n\nIn this step, I evaluate whether the deal looks reasonable based on the proposal data provided:\n\n1. **Income vs. Loan Amount**:\n   - Applicant's stated income is £20,292 per month, equating to an annual income of approximately £243,504 (£20,292 x 12). This is a very high income and potentially raises the question of why they are applying for a loan for a vehicle of retail value £42,757, which seems easily affordable based on their self-reported income. However, this evaluation has a caveat, as the missing credit report significantly affects trust in the financial data.\n\n2. **Vehicle Cost and Loan Advance**:\n   - Retail price of the vehicle is £42,757.\n   - The loan advance is £27,381, which makes sense given the cash and part-exchange deposits totaling £15,376. The figures align.\n\n3. **Loan Term**:\n   - Loan term is 36 months (3 years). For a used 2019 vehicle, this term appears reasonable.\n\n4. **Monthly Instalment**:\n   - Proposed monthly instalment is £400. This is a small fraction of the stated monthly income and hence affordable. However, this is based on stated income, which cannot currently be verified due to the lack of a credit report.\n\n### Observations:\n- The financials appear reasonable on the surface but the lack of a credit report makes it impossible to verify trustworthiness, which is concerning.\n\nProceeding to step 3 for a detailed policy verification."
