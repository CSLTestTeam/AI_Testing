Reasoning: The actual output incorrectly flags the absence of a credit report as a critical issue, despite one being available in the input, but this must not be penalized as per the evaluation instructions. Aside from this, most findings and calculations about credit tier, LTV, DTI, self-employment duration, and vehicle criteria are consistent with the input data and policy. However, the response omits key credit risk analysis from the provided credit report, such as not reporting negative factors (short credit history, high credit utilisation), nor does it highlight the store cards/overdrafts that may present moderate risk nor discuss the search history (recent hard searches), as the evaluation steps require. The reasoning is otherwise generally logical and the calculations are correct, but the incomplete reporting of credit report findings leads to a significant deduction.
