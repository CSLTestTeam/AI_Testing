Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response covers most major triage findings using proper structure and field targeting, identifies correct policy breaches (credit score, deposit, LTV, DTI), and follows step-by-step reasoning. However, it falsely reports a missing credit report as a critical issue even though the data was present, missing required step 1 data checks such as verifying that applicant details, address, and credit report information match. It neglects reporting findings for all required credit report checks, such as account status, missed payments, hard searches, and fraud markers (even to state their absence). Minor details such as the vehicle criteria and term compliance are mentioned but not formally flagged using the ReportFinding tool as per instructions. There is also a significant policy violationâ€”for Tier C, the deposit minimum is not met, and while this is described, it is not flagged in the triageFlags array. Overall, it shows reasonable alignment but misses several mandated flags and thorough checks, leading to a moderate score.
