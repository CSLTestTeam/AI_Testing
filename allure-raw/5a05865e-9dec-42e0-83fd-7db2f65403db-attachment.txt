Reasoning: The response correctly identifies the policy violation regarding exceeding the maximum loan term for the vehicle's age, noting that the 72-month term contravenes the policy's 60-month maximum and the 48-month limit for vehicles older than 5 years. The explanation references the policy section and provides clear reasoning. Findings for DTI and LTV are accurate, correctly calculated, and match the provided data. There is no evidence of hallucination except for the expected non-penalized mention of the missing credit report. A minor shortcoming is the level of detail included about other proposal aspects, which goes beyond the primary expected output focus but does not detract from faithfully surfacing the critical term violation.
