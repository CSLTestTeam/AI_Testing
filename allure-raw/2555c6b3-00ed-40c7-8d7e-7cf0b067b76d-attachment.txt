Score: 0.2000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output contains a significant hallucination: it incorrectly reports that the applicant's credit report is missing, even though the input provides a full credit report with all required fields and details. While most findings (credit score tier, LTV ratio, DTI ratio, employment duration, and vehicle age) correctly align with the input data and policy manual, the repeated statements about the absent credit report are unfaithful to the provided data. No penalty is applied for consequences stemming from the claimed missing report, but the core hallucination results in a low score for overall faithfulness.
