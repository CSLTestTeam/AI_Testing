Score: 0.5000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response faithfully checks the proposal's vehicle, loan, and DTI values against policy and reports those findings accurately. However, it incorrectly states that the DTI ratio (2.0%) is compliant with Tier C policy when, according to the provided policy and input, the applicant's monthly credit commitments (Â£2138) should be included in the calculation, resulting in a much higher DTI (over 12%). The omission of the applicant's actual monthly credit commitments from the DTI calculation is a notable inaccuracy. No other hallucinations are present except for the expected handling of the missing credit report.
