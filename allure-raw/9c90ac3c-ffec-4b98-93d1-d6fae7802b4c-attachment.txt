Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response follows the structure required in the Retrieval Context, reporting issues via triage flags with severity and detailed reasoning. It covers core policy verifications for credit tier, LTV, and DTI, referencing relevant thresholds and correctly identifies the applicant as Tier C. However, it misses critical required steps: there is no check or reported finding for data integrity between proposal and credit report (such as address, surname, or date of birth mismatches), no asset & loan structure check for vehicle age at start/end or mileage, no verification of minimum Tier C deposit, and no review of search history or financial associations for risk. There are no false mismatches reported, but several required findings are missing.
