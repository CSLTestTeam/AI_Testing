Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response is faithful to most input data, providing thorough checks for credit score, vehicle age, LTV, DTI, and policy alignment, without hallucinations. However, it fails to flag or discuss discrepancies in employment history as required by the expected output. Specifically, the applicant's months employed (7 months in the proposal) are not mentioned or compared to the credit report data, and no findings related to this issue are reported. This oversight limits alignment with the test case.
