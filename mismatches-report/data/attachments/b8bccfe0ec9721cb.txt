Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response performs thorough policy checks and correctly reports findings for credit score, LTV, and DTI alignment, but it fails to identify and report a key data integrity discrepancy: the applicant's first name differs between the proposal ('Daniel') and the credit report ('Daniela'). Detecting and reporting such a mismatch is a required step according to the evaluation instructions but was omitted. This omission significantly impacts alignment with the expected output.
