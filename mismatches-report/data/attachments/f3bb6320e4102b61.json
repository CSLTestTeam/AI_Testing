    ],
    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n\n- **Substep 1a - Data Integrity:**  \nThis step was skipped due to the unavailability of the credit report. No comparison to real data could be performed.\n\n- **Substep 1b - Credit Risk Analysis:**  \nThis was also skipped due to lack of credit data in the provided credit report.\n\nFinding: **Critical severity identified due to missing credit report, as noted above.**\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nAnalyzing the provided data:\n- The applicant lists a high monthly income of $20,292, which seems plausible for a \"Technical Lead\" role. However, further validation cannot be done due to the missing credit report.\n- The loan amount of $27,381 appears reasonable compared to the applicant's stated income, but again, without the ability to verify liabilities, this check is inconclusive.\n- There is no egregious discrepancy between vehicle value and the requested loan amount.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\nThe `Applicant.CreditScore` is provided as 731, which indicates good creditworthiness. However, since the credit report is missing, this score cannot be corroborated.\n\nSteps to verify:\n1. I will search the policy regarding credit tier criteria.\n2. If I find relevant details, I will validate whether the score meets the requirements.\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure\nChecks:\n1. Verify the vehicle's age and mileage against policy rules.\n2. Calculate the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio for the proposed loan and compare it to policy guidelines.\n3. Validate the loan term (36 months) against policy restrictions.\n\nI'll retrieve the \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\" policy to perform all these checks.\n\n#### 3c. Affordability\nTo ensure the applicant can afford the loan, I'll:\n1. Retrieve the policy on \"DTI (Debt-to-Income) thresholds.\"\n2. Calculate the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio using the applicant's proposed installment ($400), income, and assumed other debts.\n\nI will execute the pending analyses using parallel tools and retrieve relevant policies.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n1. **Credit Risk**\n   - Based on the credit tiers defined in Section 2.1 of the policy manual, a credit score of 731 places the applicant in Tier A (Prime), which allows for the best rates and most flexible terms.\n   - **Finding logged:** Applicant's credit score qualifies for Tier A and best rates.\n\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure**\n   - **Vehicle Age:** The vehicle's manufacturing year is 2019, so its age at the start of the agreement is 6 years, and it will be 9 years at the loan's end (36-month term). This falls within the permissible maximum of 8 years at the start and 12 years by the end of the term as per Section 4.2.\n   - **Mileage:** The vehicle's mileage of 48,024 miles is well below the maximum allowable start mileage of 100,000, as stated in Section 4.2.\n   - **LTV Ratio:** Calculated as 67.97%. Tier A allows a maximum LTV of 110%, so this is well within acceptable limits per Section 4.1.\n   - **Loan Term:** The loan term is 36 months, which is permissible for a vehicle of this age and complies with the general maximum of 60 months as per Section 4.3.\n\n   **Findings logged:** \n   - Vehicle age and mileage comply with the policy's age and mileage criteria.\n   - The LTV ratio of 67.97% is within the Tier A maximum limit of 110%.\n\n3. **Affordability**\n   - **DTI Ratio:** Calculated as 2.0% (using stated monthly income). Tier A allows a maximum DTI of 45%, so this is significantly below the threshold per Section 3.1.\n   - The stated monthly income of $20,292 was used for the calculation, but no income verification documents were provided for confirmation.\n\n   **Findings logged:** The DTI ratio of 2.0% complies with Tier A affordability limits.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining all findings:\n- The applicant is in the Prime (Tier A) credit band.\n- Both DTI (2.0%) and LTV (67.97%) are well within Tier A thresholds, highlighting excellent affordability and low loan risk.\n- The vehicle fits perfectly within age and mileage criteria.\n- However, data verification through a credit report and income validation remains impossible without further details.\n- Despite an exceptionally strong profile within the parameters, the missing credit report remains a critical barrier.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe applicant and vehicle qualify strongly under most underwriting rules, but the absence of the credit report prevents a full evaluation of risks like undisclosed financial liabilities or fraud markers.\n\n**Findings Summary:** \n- Critical issue: Missing credit report.\n- Several other positive observations (Credit Score, DTI, LTV, Vehicle Age, Mileage compliance) logged as low severity for context.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
