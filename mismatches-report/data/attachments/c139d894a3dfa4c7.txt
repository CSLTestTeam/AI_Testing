Reasoning: The response provides a thorough triage, reporting multiple policy checks and accurately reflecting proposal data. Critically, it does not mention the mismatch between the applicant's current address in the proposal ('246 Queen Street') and the current address in the credit report ('248 Queen Street'), which is a required finding per Step 1a. No hallucinations are present except for the expected credit report absence error, which per instructions is not penalised. The output is otherwise faithful and systematic but misses the key required discrepancy.
