Reasoning: The response comprehensively reviewed all relevant policy checks, flagged critical and low-severity findings, and followed the mandated five-step process. However, it did not report or mention the mismatch between the proposal and credit report address details (street: '246 Queen Street' in the proposal vs '248 Queen Street' in the credit report), which is specifically required by both the process and the expected output. This omission is a significant shortcoming. All other evaluation logic steps were followed correctly.
