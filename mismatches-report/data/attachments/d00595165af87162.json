    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Credit Report Issue:** The credit report for the applicant is unavailable, meaning an entire segment of verification data is missing. A finding with \"Critical\" severity was reported.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- While the credit report absence raises major concerns, based on the provided data:\n  - The loan amount of £27,381 is relatively modest compared to the applicant's stated net monthly income of £20,292.\n  - The requested vehicle, a 2019 Honda Jazz with a retail price of £42,757, seems reasonable given the applicant's income.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n**3a. Credit Risk**\n- Using the policy, the applicant’s credit score of 731 qualifies them for Tier A, which is the best available tier. Finding of \"Low\" severity was reported to confirm eligibility in Tier A.\n\n**3b. Asset & Loan Verification**\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n  - Calculated LTV is 67.97%, which is within the allowable maximum of 110% for Tier A.\n  - A finding with \"Low\" severity was reported to confirm compliance with the LTV requirement.\n- **Vehicle Criteria:**\n  - Age at the start of the agreement is 6 years (2025-2019=6).\n  - Age at the end of the term is 6 years + 3 years = 9 years.\n  - Complies with maximum allowed vehicle age of 12 years at the end of the term. Finding of \"Low\" severity reported.\n  - The mileage is 48,024, significantly below the maximum allowed of 100,000. A \"Low\" severity finding confirms this compliance.\n\n**3c. Affordability Verification**\n- **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**\n  - Calculated DTI is 2%, which is far below the maximum threshold of 45% for Tier A applicants.\n  - A \"Low\" severity finding confirms the DTI calculation is within acceptable limits.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The applicant is within compliance for all important metrics:\n  - Credit Tier: Tier A.\n  - LTV: Well within maximum thresholds.\n  - DTI: Very low, suggesting affordability is not a concern.\n  - Vehicle criteria (age and mileage): Acceptable.\n- The lack of a credit report is the sole critical stumbling block in this case.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe primary concern is the missing credit report, which significantly hampers underwriting and necessitates outright rejection of the proposal unless the credit report can be retrieved. In all other respects, this proposal is strong and compliant with relevant policies.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
