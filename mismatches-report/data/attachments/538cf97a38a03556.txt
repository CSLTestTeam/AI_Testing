Score: 0.7000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output is generally faithful to the input and does not contain hallucinations except for the expected missing credit report flag, which is not penalized. However, it fails to note that there is a discrepancy between the applicant's first name in the proposal ('Daniel') and the credit report ('Daniela'), which is a required finding per step 1a. All other conclusions regarding credit score, loan-to-value, and DTI are accurate and matched to the input data.
