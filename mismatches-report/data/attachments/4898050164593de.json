    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Data Verification:** This step was skipped as there is no credit report available for this proposal. A critical finding regarding the absence of the credit report was reported.\n2. **Credit Analysis:** Skipped due to the lack of a credit report.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The proposal appears coherent when examining the core financials.\n- The applicant's declared income is sufficient to support the proposed loan and monthly installment.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk Verification**:\n   - The applicant's credit score (731) places them in Tier A, qualifying for the best rates and terms per policy Section 2.1.\n   - Finding reported: The credit score qualifies for Tier A.\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure Verification**:\n   - Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:\n     - Using `FinancialCalculator.CalculateLTV`, the LTV ratio was determined to be **67.97%**, well within the Tier A maximum limit of 110% as per policy Section 4.1.\n     - Finding reported: LTV conforms to policy requirements.\n   - Vehicle Criteria:\n     - Vehicle's age at the start of the agreement: **4 years (2025 - 2019)**, which is within the maximum allowable age of 8 years.\n     - Vehicle's age at the end of the agreement: **7 years (4 years + 36-month term)**, within the maximum of 12 years.\n     - Vehicle mileage is **48,024 miles**, well below the maximum allowable of 100,000 miles as per policy Section 4.2.\n   - Loan Term:\n     - Loan term of **36 months (3 years)** is below the maximum allowable term of 60 months for a vehicle that is less than 5 years old (Policy Section 4.3).\n3. **Affordability Verification**:\n   - Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:\n     - Using `FinancialCalculator.CalculateDTI`, the DTI ratio was determined to be **2%**, far below the Tier A maximum of 45% as allowed in policy Section 3.1.\n     - Finding reported: DTI is within allowable maximum.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The proposal is strong, with no significant risks or policy breaches identified.\n- Positive metrics (low LTV, low DTI, Tier A credit score) indicate the proposal is well-aligned with policy criteria.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nAll prescribed analysis steps have been completed. Findings are consolidated below:\n\n1. **Critical Finding:**\n   - **Credit report is missing**, which is a violation of policy and prevents a full risk assessment.\n\n2. **Low-Severity Findings:**\n   - Applicant qualifies for **Tier A** based on a credit score of 731.\n   - **LTV ratio** of 67.97% is well within Tier A policy thresholds (<=110%).\n   - **DTI ratio** of 2% is significantly below the allowable maximum of 45% for Tier A.\n\nWhile the figures strongly qualify this proposal as compliant with underwriting policy, the absence of the credit report presents a critical risk that must be addressed before a final decision can be made.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
