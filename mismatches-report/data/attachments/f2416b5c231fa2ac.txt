Score: 0.7000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response thoroughly analyzes the applicant's credit score, DTI, LTV, vehicle age, and mileage, referencing policy sections accurately, with no hallucinated details except for the handling of the credit report, which should not be penalized. However, it fails to identify a key data integrity issue: a postcode mismatch between the applicant's address in the proposal ('BS1 1AA') and the address in the credit report ('GS1 5BA'). This discrepancy should have been flagged as per the evaluation steps. Otherwise, the findings are faithful and well-grounded.
