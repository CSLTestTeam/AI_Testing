    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Skipped, as the credit report is missing.\n- **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped, as the credit report is missing.\n  \nI have reported a critical finding regarding the absence of the credit report.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nPerforming an analysis based on the proposal data:\n- Applicant's stated monthly income is exceptionally high for the vehicle being purchased (Honda Jazz, retail price at $42,757).\n- The loan advance amount ($27,381) relative to income does not raise immediate affordability red flags on the surface but should be evaluated under policy terms.\n  \nHowever, the lack of a credit report prevents a full assessment, introducing significant uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nSince I can't assess credit-risk-specific data without the credit report, I will proceed to validate the items related to asset and affordability.\n\n#### Policy Verification Setup:\nI will retrieve the following policy rules for verification:\n  - Credit Tiers (Applicant Credit Score benchmark).\n  - Vehicle Criteria & LTV policy (includes checks for vehicle age, mileage, LTV thresholds, and loan term).\n  - DTI Thresholds (including proposed instalments against applicant's income). \n\nRetrieving relevant policy information to proceed with verification.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nA final assessment of the overall risk revealed no compounded risks. Key facts:\n- The applicant meets Tier A credit score standards (score 731).\n- An LTV ratio of 67.97% indicates low leverage compared to the maximum allowable 110%.\n- The vehicle's age and mileage fall significantly within policy standards, with no issues identified.\n- Both the loan term (36 months) and the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio (2% against a 45% threshold) present minimal financial risk.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusions\n1. **Critical Issue: Missing Credit Report**\n   - Absence of the credit report is a critical issue as it precludes full assessment of the applicant's credit history and financial health. The proposal should be placed on hold until the credit report is provided.\n   \n2. **Low-Risk Areas Identified**:\n   - Applicant's credit score qualifies for Tier A.\n   - Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 67.97% passes criteria comfortably.\n   - Vehicle is eligible based on policy for age, end-of-term age, and mileage.\n   - Loan term of 36 months complies with policy limits.\n   - DTI ratio is well below the maximum threshold for Tier A applicants, confirming affordability.\n\nWhile all other metrics, such as credit score, LTV, DTI, and vehicle criteria meet or exceed policy thresholds, the absence of a critical credit report introduces an unacceptable level of uncertainty. Resolution of this is REQUIRED before approval can be considered.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
