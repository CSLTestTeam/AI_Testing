Conditions and risks must align with Tier B requirements.\\n2. **LTV Calculation:**\\n   - The calculated LTV ratio is 67.97%.

This exceeds the maximum allowable age of 12 years at loan term end (Section 4.2).\\n   - **Reported Findings:** Medium violation for exceeding vehicle age limits.\\n5. **DTI Calculation:**\\n   - Calculated DTI is 8%, well within the 40% limit for Tier B applicants. This complies with Section 3.1.\\n   - **Reported Findings:** Low finding for successful DTI valuation.\\n\\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\\nThe proposal presents multiple Medium-severity violations when assessed as a whole:\\n- **Missing Credit Report:** This is critical and overshadows all other findings.\\n- **LTV and term exceedances:** Both structurally increase risk beyond acceptable underwriting parameters.\\n- **Vehicle final-age violation:** Raises residual value and depreciation concerns, compounding loan risk.\\n\\n### Step 5: Conclusion and Recommendations\\nThe absence of a credit report renders the applicant's proposal fundamentally incomplete. Multiple structural violations (LTV, loan term, vehicle age) further make the deal unapprovable in its current form. \\n\\n**Recommendations to Human Underwriter:**\\n- Request detailed credit report and background checks to address the critical risk gap.\\n- Decline the proposal unless structural adjustments are made to address LTV, term length, and vehicle age violations.\\n\\n**Final Status:** TRIAGE_COMPLETE\"\n}", "retrievalContext": ["\n    public static List<TriageFlag> Flags { get; set; } = [];\n\n    [KernelFunction, Description(\"Use this function to report a single issue, risk, or policy violation you have found.\")]\n    public void ReportFinding(\n        [Description(\"The severity of the issue, must be one of 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', or 'Critical'.\")] string severity,\n        [Description(\"A short, descriptive title for the issue.\")] string title,\n        [Description(\"The specific field path in the proposal JSON that this issue relates to (e.g., 'Applicant.CreditScore', 'Vehicle.Age', 'Financials.TermMonths').\")] string targetField,\n        [Description(\"The current value found in the target field.\")] string currentValue,\n        [Description(\"The expected value according to policy, or 'N/A' if not applicable.\")] string expectedValue,\n        [Description(\"A concise, one-sentence description of the issue.\")] string description,\n        [Description(\"A one-sentence recommendation for the underwriter.\")] string recommendation,\n        [Description(\"Your detailed reasoning for flagging this issue, referencing specific policy rules and data points.\")] string reasoning\n    )\n    {\n        // Simple data validation before adding\n        if (Enum.TryParse<EnSeverity>(severity, true, out EnSeverity parsedSeverity))\n        {\n            Flags.Add(new TriageFlag\n            {\n                Severity = parsedSeverity,\n                Title = title,\n                Description = description,\n                Recommendation = recommendation,\n                Reasoning = reasoning,\n                TargetField = targetField,\n                CurrentValue = currentValue,\n                ExpectedValue = expectedValue,\n            });\n        }\n    }", "You are \"Sentry\", a Senior Underwriting Analyst. Your task is to perform a methodical, comprehensive triage of the provided proposal.

Do not skip any steps.\n                \n                **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis (The \"Sleuth Work\")**\n                You have been provided with both the proposal and the applicant's credit report. Your first task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the credit report and verify the integrity of the application data.\n                \n                *   **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Meticulously compare the `proposalJson` and `creditReportJson`. For EACH discrepancy you find, no matter how small, you MUST call `Findings.ReportFinding`. Pay close attention to:\n                    *   `Applicant.LastName`\n                    *   `Applicant.DateOfBirth`\n                    *   `Applicant.CurrentAddress.Postcode`\n                \n                *   **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Analyze the `creditReportJson` for the applicant's overall financial health. For EACH negative factor you identify, you MUST call `Findings.ReportFinding`. Scrutinize the following sections:\n                    *   **`creditScoreSummary`**: Note the overall score and the key negative factors listed.\n                    *   **`creditAccounts`**: Look for any accounts with a `status` of \"Defaulted\", recent missed payments in the `paymentHistory_24m` string, and high credit utilisation (where `currentBalance` is close to `creditLimit`).\n                    *   **`searchHistory`**: Look for a high number of \"Hard\" searches in the last 3 months, which indicates credit-seeking behavior.\n                    *   **`fraudWarnings`**: Report any markers found in this section as a \"High\" severity finding.\n                \n                **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check (The \"Gut Check\")**\n                Based on the data and your credit analysis, quickly analyze the core figures. Does the deal make sense? Is a customer with this credit profile typically applying for a vehicle of this value? Is the loan amount reasonable for their income? If you spot a major \"smell test\" failure, report it.\n                \n                **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (The \"Science\")**\n                Methodically check the proposal against the company's policy manual. For each check, you MUST first use the `Policy.Search` tool to retrieve the relevant rule, then compare the proposal data to that rule.\n                \n                *   **3a. Credit Risk:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"Credit Tiers\". Verify `Applicant.CreditScore` against the retrieved policy.\n                *   **3b. Asset & Loan Structure:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\". Validate the vehicle's age and mileage. Use `FinancialCalculator.CalculateLTV` and check the result against the retrieved policy. Check the loan term.\n                *   **3c. Affordability:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"DTI Thresholds\". Use `FinancialCalculator.CalculateDTI` and compare the result against the retrieved policy.\n                \n                **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis (The \"Art\")**\n                After checking all individual rules, take a final look at the complete picture. Are there any *combinations* of low-severity issues that together suggest a higher risk? (e.g., borderline credit score + borderline high LTV + max term). If you identify a synthesized risk, call `Findings.ReportFinding` and explain your reasoning in detail.\n                \n                **Step 5: Conclude Your Review**\n                Once you have completed all steps and are certain you have reported all possible findings, your final response must detail the steps you took and your reasoning throughout the whole process for explainability, and then conclude with the exact phrase 'TRIAGE_COMPLETE'.\n                \n                ## Proposal Data\n                ```json\n                {proposalJson}\n                ```\n                \n                ## Credit Report Data\n                ```json\n                {creditReportData}", "# Oakwood Motor Finance - Underwriting Policy Manual\n\n        **Document ID:** OMF-POL-UW-2024-v3.1\n        **Effective Date:** 01 August 2024\n        **Status:** ACTIVE\n        **Owner:** Head of Credit Risk\n\n        ## 1.0 Introduction & Core Principles\n\n        This document outlines the underwriting criteria and risk appetite for Oakwood Motor Finance. Our primary goal is to conduct responsible, fair, and consistent lending in accordance with Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations.\n\n        All lending decisions must balance commercial objectives with a duty of care to our customers, ensuring affordability and suitability. This manual serves as the primary source of truth for all underwriting decisions.\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 2.0 Credit Risk Assessment\n\n        Customer creditworthiness is assessed using a tiered system based on their credit score, obtained from our designated Credit Reference Agency (CRA).\n\n        ### 2.1 Credit Tiers\n\n        | Tier | Credit Score Band | Notes |\n        | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n        | **A (Prime)** | 700+ | Eligible for best rates and most flexible terms. |\n        | **B (Near-Prime)** | 620 - 699 | Standard terms apply. May require stricter affordability checks. |\n        | **C (Sub-Prime)** | 550 - 619 | Requires stricter lending criteria, including potential deposit minimums. |\n        | **D (Decline)** | Below 550 | Automatic decline unless exceptional, documented circumstances exist. |\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 3.0 Affordability Assessment\n\n        Affordability is primarily assessed using the **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** ratio.\n\n        `DTI = (Total Monthly Credit Commitments + Proposed Monthly Instalment) / Verified Net Monthly Income`\n\n        ### 3.1 DTI Thresholds\n\n        The maximum allowable DTI ratio is determined by the applicant's Credit Tier:\n\n        *   **Tier A:** Maximum DTI is **45%**.\n        *   **Tier B:** Maximum DTI is **40%**.\n        *   **Tier C:** Maximum DTI is **35%**.\n\n        ### 3.2 Income Verification\n\n        *   **Standard Employment (PAYE):** Income must be verified via the most recent payslip. If the stated income on the application differs from the payslip by more than **5%**, the lower value (payslip) must be used for all calculations.\n        *   **Self-Employed:** A minimum of **2 years** of tax returns or accountant-verified statements are required. The average net income over the two years should be used.\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 4.0 Asset & Loan Structure Rules\n\n        These rules govern the structure of the finance agreement itself.\n\n        ### 4.1 Loan-to-Value (LTV)\n\n        LTV is calculated as `(Total Advance) / (Vehicle Trade Price)`. The maximum permitted LTV is based on the Credit Tier:\n\n        *   **Tier A:** Max LTV is **110%**. (Allows financing of fees or small amounts of negative equity).\n        *   **Tier B:** Max LTV is **100%**.\n        *   **Tier C:** Max LTV is **95%**.\n\n        ### 4.2 Vehicle Criteria\n\n        *   **Maximum Age at Start of Agreement:** **8 years**.\n        *   **Maximum Age at End of Agreement:** **12 years**.

Do not skip any steps.\n                \n                **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis (The \"Sleuth Work\")**\n                You have been provided with both the proposal and the applicant's credit report. Your first task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the credit report and verify the integrity of the application data.\n                \n                *   **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Meticulously compare the `proposalJson` and `creditReportJson`. For EACH discrepancy you find, no matter how small, you MUST call `Findings.ReportFinding`. Pay close attention to:\n                    *   `Applicant.LastName`\n                    *   `Applicant.DateOfBirth`\n                    *   `Applicant.CurrentAddress.Postcode`\n                \n                *   **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Analyze the `creditReportJson` for the applicant's overall financial health. For EACH negative factor you identify, you MUST call `Findings.ReportFinding`. Scrutinize the following sections:\n                    *   **`creditScoreSummary`**: Note the overall score and the key negative factors listed.\n                    *   **`creditAccounts`**: Look for any accounts with a `status` of \"Defaulted\", recent missed payments in the `paymentHistory_24m` string, and high credit utilisation (where `currentBalance` is close to `creditLimit`).\n                    *   **`searchHistory`**: Look for a high number of \"Hard\" searches in the last 3 months, which indicates credit-seeking behavior.\n                    *   **`fraudWarnings`**: Report any markers found in this section as a \"High\" severity finding.\n                \n                **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check (The \"Gut Check\")**\n                Based on the data and your credit analysis, quickly analyze the core figures. Does the deal make sense? Is a customer with this credit profile typically applying for a vehicle of this value? Is the loan amount reasonable for their income? If you spot a major \"smell test\" failure, report it.\n                \n                **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (The \"Science\")**\n                Methodically check the proposal against the company's policy manual. For each check, you MUST first use the `Policy.Search` tool to retrieve the relevant rule, then compare the proposal data to that rule.\n                \n                *   **3a. Credit Risk:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"Credit Tiers\". Verify `Applicant.CreditScore` against the retrieved policy.\n                *   **3b. Asset & Loan Structure:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\". Validate the vehicle's age and mileage. Use `FinancialCalculator.CalculateLTV` and check the result against the retrieved policy. Check the loan term.\n                *   **3c. Affordability:** Use `Policy.Search` for \"DTI Thresholds\". Use `FinancialCalculator.CalculateDTI` and compare the result against the retrieved policy.\n                \n                **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis (The \"Art\")**\n                After checking all individual rules, take a final look at the complete picture. Are there any *combinations* of low-severity issues that together suggest a higher risk? (e.g., borderline credit score + borderline high LTV + max term). If you identify a synthesized risk, call `Findings.ReportFinding` and explain your reasoning in detail.\n                \n                **Step 5: Conclude Your Review**\n                Once you have completed all steps and are certain you have reported all possible findings, your final response must detail the steps you took and your reasoning throughout the whole process for explainability, and then conclude with the exact phrase 'TRIAGE_COMPLETE'.\n                \n                ## Proposal Data\n                ```json\n                {proposalJson}\n                ```\n                \n                ## Credit Report Data\n                ```json\n                {creditReportData}", "# Oakwood Motor Finance - Underwriting Policy Manual\n\n        **Document ID:** OMF-POL-UW-2024-v3.1\n        **Effective Date:** 01 August 2024\n        **Status:** ACTIVE\n        **Owner:** Head of Credit Risk\n\n        ## 1.0 Introduction & Core Principles\n\n        This document outlines the underwriting criteria and risk appetite for Oakwood Motor Finance. Our primary goal is to conduct responsible, fair, and consistent lending in accordance with Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations.\n\n        All lending decisions must balance commercial objectives with a duty of care to our customers, ensuring affordability and suitability. This manual serves as the primary source of truth for all underwriting decisions.\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 2.0 Credit Risk Assessment\n\n        Customer creditworthiness is assessed using a tiered system based on their credit score, obtained from our designated Credit Reference Agency (CRA).\n\n        ### 2.1 Credit Tiers\n\n        | Tier | Credit Score Band | Notes |\n        | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n        | **A (Prime)** | 700+ | Eligible for best rates and most flexible terms. |\n        | **B (Near-Prime)** | 620 - 699 | Standard terms apply. May require stricter affordability checks. |\n        | **C (Sub-Prime)** | 550 - 619 | Requires stricter lending criteria, including potential deposit minimums. |\n        | **D (Decline)** | Below 550 | Automatic decline unless exceptional, documented circumstances exist. |\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 3.0 Affordability Assessment\n\n        Affordability is primarily assessed using the **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** ratio.\n\n        `DTI = (Total Monthly Credit Commitments + Proposed Monthly Instalment) / Verified Net Monthly Income`\n\n        ### 3.1 DTI Thresholds\n\n        The maximum allowable DTI ratio is determined by the applicant's Credit Tier:\n\n        *   **Tier A:** Maximum DTI is **45%**.\n        *   **Tier B:** Maximum DTI is **40%**.\n        *   **Tier C:** Maximum DTI is **35%**.\n\n        ### 3.2 Income Verification\n\n        *   **Standard Employment (PAYE):** Income must be verified via the most recent payslip. If the stated income on the application differs from the payslip by more than **5%**, the lower value (payslip) must be used for all calculations.\n        *   **Self-Employed:** A minimum of **2 years** of tax returns or accountant-verified statements are required. The average net income over the two years should be used.\n\n        ---\n\n        ## 4.0 Asset & Loan Structure Rules\n\n        These rules govern the structure of the finance agreement itself.\n\n        ### 4.1 Loan-to-Value (LTV)\n\n        LTV is calculated as `(Total Advance) / (Vehicle Trade Price)`. The maximum permitted LTV is based on the Credit Tier:\n\n        *   **Tier A:** Max LTV is **110%**. (Allows financing of fees or small amounts of negative equity).\n        *   **Tier B:** Max LTV is **100%**.\n        *   **Tier C:** Max LTV is **95%**.\n\n        ### 4.2 Vehicle Criteria\n\n        *   **Maximum Age at Start of Agreement:** **8 years**.\n        *   **Maximum Age at End of Agreement:** **12 years**.
