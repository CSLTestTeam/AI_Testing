The applicant's credit score places them in Tier A, which allows for a maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) of 110% and a Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 45%. The calculated LTV is 91.11%, and the DTI is 42.5%, both within acceptable limits but requiring verification for accuracy. The vehicle's age and mileage comply with policy requirements, and the loan term is within the maximum allowed duration. No critical issues were identified, but the findings highlight areas for further verification."
