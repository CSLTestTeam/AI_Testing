Metric: Hallucination
Status: FAIL
Score: 0.4000
Threshold: 0.8000
Reasoning: The output incorrectly flags the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio as exceeding policy limits despite the current value (91.11%) being below the expected maximum for Tier A (110% as per the input reasoning). This is a clear contradiction with the input data and policy, indicating hallucination or mistake. Additionally, the Debt-to-Income (DTI) flag incorrectly states the DTI exceeds policy limit, yet it is well within the allowed 45%. The reasoning claims compliance but the triageFlags contradict it, showing inconsistency and undermining faithfulness. No calculation errors other than policy misinterpretation noted, and the vehicle criteria and applicant data align with the input. The output also redundantly flags issues despite no breaches. Mentions of missing credit report are ignored per instructions.
