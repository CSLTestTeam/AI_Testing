Metric: Hallucination
Status: PASS
Score: 0.8000
Threshold: 0.8000
Reasoning: The output correctly identifies missing Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income (DTI) calculations, which are critical and absent in the input proposal data, aligning with policy requirements. The reasoning accurately references the applicant's credit tier (Tier A based on a credit score of 720) and correctly states the relevant maximum thresholds (45% DTI and 110% LTV). The policy criteria regarding vehicle age, mileage, and term length are correctly affirmed as met. There are no hallucinations or fabricated information besides the acceptable omission of credit report presence. However, the output does not provide the actual calculated LTV and DTI values derived from input data, missing an opportunity to confirm compliance rather than just flagging absence. This limitation reduces completeness but does not introduce errors or contradictions.
