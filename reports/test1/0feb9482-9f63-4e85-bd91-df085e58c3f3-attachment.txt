Metric: Hallucination
Status: FAIL
Score: 0.7000
Threshold: 0.8000
Reasoning: The output correctly identifies medium severity flags relating to Loan-to-Value and Debt-to-Income ratios exceeding policy limits, referencing values that match the input financials (LTV calculated as 41000/45000=91.11%) and DTI percentages consistent with the data. It provides clear reasoning and recommendations aligned with policy thresholds. However, it hallucinates policy limits by stating the LTV max as 90%, while the policy in the context defines max LTV as 110% for Tier A and 100% for Tier B, making the flagged LTV incorrect. The output also inconsistently mixes credit tiers (A and B) in flags without clear basis from the input credit score (720, Tier A). Despite multiple duplicated flags and slight inaccuracies in expected values, no critical inconsistencies or unsupported claims exist besides the LTV limit confusion. The missing credit report mentions are ignored per instructions. Overall, the analysis is mostly faithful with minor policy misapplication and redundant flags.
