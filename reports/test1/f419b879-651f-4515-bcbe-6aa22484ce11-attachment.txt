Metric: Hallucination
Status: PASS
Score: 0.8000
Threshold: 0.8000
Reasoning: The output correctly identifies the applicant's age of 120 years as a critical issue consistent with the input's birth date (1905), demonstrating factual alignment without hallucination. It properly flags missing calculations for Loan-to-Value and Debt-to-Income ratios, which are indeed absent in the input financials. There are no calculation discrepancies as the LTV and DTI are not computed rather than incorrectly computed. The reasoning is logical and coherent describing the significance of these missing metrics. The only minor shortcoming is the absence of explicit findings related to potential policy checks such as maximum vehicle age or affordability thresholds, which might have been expected given the input and policy, but this does not affect correctness or introduce hallucinations. The treatment of the missing credit report is appropriately ignored per evaluation instructions.
