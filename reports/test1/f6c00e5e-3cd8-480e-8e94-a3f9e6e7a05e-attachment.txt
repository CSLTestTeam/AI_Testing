Reasoning: The actual output correctly identifies the critical issue that the applicant is below the minimum legal age of 18, which matches the input showing the applicant is 10 years old. It also notes the medium-severity findings that the Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios were not calculated, which is faithful to the input data where these values are zero. There are no hallucinations or fabricated details; all findings are justified and consistent with the input data. The reasoning is logical and coherent. The only minor shortcoming is the absence of explicit LTV or DTI calculation attempts, but given zeros are provided, reporting the missing calculations is appropriate. The requirement to ignore missing credit report mentions is respected. Overall, the response is accurate, complete, and well-reasoned.
