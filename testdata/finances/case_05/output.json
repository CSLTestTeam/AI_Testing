The applicant's credit score qualifies for Tier A, which allows for a maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) of 90% and a Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 40%. However, the proposal's LTV is 91.11%, exceeding the policy limit, and the DTI is 41.25%, also above the allowed threshold. These findings indicate a medium risk level due to the policy violations."
