    "reasoning": "### Summary of Findings:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **No Credit Report Provided**: A critical finding that prevents mandatory credit analysis, reported and flagged.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- **Initial Assessment**: The loan requested and the customer's profile (stated income, credit score, and terms) align well with standard expectations for a Tier A applicant.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Tier**:\n   - Applicant qualifies for **Tier A** based on a credit score of **950**. Policy requires 700+ for this tier.\n   - Finding reported as low severity for documentation.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n   - Calculated **LTV** is **67.97%**. Policy allows **up to 110%** for Tier A.\n   - Within acceptable policy limits.\n\n3. **Vehicle Criteria**:\n   - Vehicle under agreement will be 9 years old at the end of the proposed 36-month term.\n   - Policy allows a maximum end-of-agreement age of 12 years.\n\n4. **Affordability (DTI)**:\n   - Calculated Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is **31%**, well below the maximum allowed **45%** for Tier A.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The vehicle age, LTV ratio, and DTI ratio are all significantly within safe thresholds. Combined with the credit tier and favorable terms, the application presents a low-risk profile. \n- However, the absence of a credit report remains a critical issue that must be addressed immediately to ensure compliance with core risk assessment requirements.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nWith all analysis complete, findings have been logged, and my final recommendation reflects significant risk due to the missing credit report. Until a credit report is provided, underwriting cannot proceed.\n\n### Status: TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
