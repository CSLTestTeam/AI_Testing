    "reasoning": "# Review Summary and Reasoning\n\n## Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **1a. Data Integrity**: This step was skipped as no valid credit report was available for verification.\n- **1b. Credit Risk**: Skipped due to the absence of a credit report. This was reported as a critical finding as it affects the ability to validate the applicant's financial health or assess associated risks accurately.\n\n## Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe proposal does not exhibit major inconsistencies or outliers in terms of declared income, vehicle cost, or loan terms relative to the applicant's profile and Credit Tier. Though no \"smell test\" issues arise, the lack of a credit report remains an impediment to a full assessment.\n\n## Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n### 3a. Credit Risk\n- Identified **Tier A (Prime)** placement based on a credit score of 750 (policy requires ≥700 for this tier).\n  - **Finding**: Recorded as a **Low Severity** fact under Credit Policy.\n\n### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure\n1. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n   - The calculated LTV is **67.97%**, which is well below the **110%** maximum threshold allowed for Tier A applicants.\n   - **Finding**: No violations; LTV compliance logged as **Low Severity.**\n\n2. **Vehicle Age**:\n   - At the start of the agreement, the vehicle will be **6 years old**, and it will be **9 years old** by the term's end. Both are within policy age limits of 8 years (start) and 12 years (end).\n   - **Finding**: Age compliance recorded as **Low Severity**.\n\n3. **Vehicle Mileage**:\n   - Mileage at 48,024 miles meets the policy limit of **≤100,000 miles at the start of the agreement**.\n   - **Finding**: Mileage compliance recorded as **Low Severity**.\n\n4. Term Length:\n   - Proposed term length of **36 months** falls under the **60 months max permitted term** for vehicles ≤5 years old.\n\n### 3c. Affordability\n1. **Income Verification**: Not possible due to the absence of supporting documents or pay slips.\n2. **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**:\n   - Using the applicant's stated income of **$5,292**, a proposed monthly instalment of **$400**, and assuming no other monthly commitments for now due to lack of credit file:\n       - Calculated **DTI = (0 + 400) / 5292 × 100 = 8.8%**.\n   - This is significantly below the **45% max allowable DTI for Tier A applicants**.\n   - **Finding**: DTI compliance recorded as **Low Severity.**\n\n## Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nWhile no individual issues are significant, an anomaly emerges in the combination of the missing credit report:\n- Without a credit report, critical validation steps related to affordability, payment history, and prior defaults cannot be conducted. As a result, it remains impossible to assess this proposal holistically.\n\n### Summary Findings\nAll findings have been recorded in their respective severity levels:\n1. **Critical**: Missing credit report prevents full credit analysis.\n2. **Low**: Compliance identified across all other tested areas, including Credit Tier, LTV, vehicle criteria, and DTI metrics.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nAll steps have been conducted methodically, and findings are recorded with detailed reasoning. **TRIAGE_COMPLETE.**"
