    "reasoning": "### Steps Taken and Reasoning:\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Skipped, as no credit report was provided. Reported this critical issue as the absence of a credit report makes it impossible to verify fields such as Last Name, Date of Birth, and Address against official records.\n- **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped due to lack of a credit report. Noted this as a serious limitation and already flagged in critical findings.\n\n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- Given the stated income, total loan advance, and term structure, the deal does appear consistent with what one might expect for a buyer of this vehicle. No major discrepancies found based on the vehicle type and applicant's details.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **3a. Credit Risk**\n  - Credit Score: The applicant's credit score is 950, clearly falling into Tier A (policy requires 700+ for this tier). No findings were reported here, as it meets the Tier A standard.\n  \n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):** Calculation revealed the proposal has an LTV of 67.97%. Policy allows up to 110% for Tier A applicants, so this is acceptable. A low-severity finding was logged for confirmation.\n  - **Vehicle Age:** At the start of the agreement, the vehicle (2019) is 6 years old, and at the end of the 36-month term, it will be 8 years old, both within policy limits of 8 and 12 years, respectively. Two low-severity findings were logged confirming compliance.\n  - **Vehicle Mileage:** At 48,024 miles, the vehicle is under the 100,000-mile maximum set by the policy. A low-severity finding was logged to acknowledge compliance.\n  \n- **3c. Affordability**\n  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio:** The calculated DTI (17%) is far below the maximum of 45% for Tier A applicants, verifying affordability as per policy guidelines. A low-severity finding was logged to confirm compliance.\n  - **Stated Income Verification:** Policy mandates income verification via the applicant's latest payslip. This is missing in the provided information, so a medium-severity finding was logged to recommend the underwriter obtain the required verification.\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- Despite several key aspects being compliant (LTV, DTI, vehicle age/mileage), the absence of a credit report and unverified income represent significant issues for the underwriting process. The application cannot move forward without addressing these foundational problems.\n\n#### **Step 5: Conclude Review**\nFinal findings and recommendations have been reported to ensure a complete and transparent triage process.\n\n### Final Remarks:\nWhile the majority of individual policy criteria are met, the absence of a required credit report and verified income are critical blockers. These must be resolved before proceeding.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
