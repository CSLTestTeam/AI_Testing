    "reasoning": "### Systematic Review Summary:\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- Skipped due to **Critical Issue**: No credit report was provided.\n  - Reported: \"No credit report submitted with the application,\" which is an essential component for underwriting analysis.\n\n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- Reviewed the overall proposal. The applicant appears to have a strong income level and is requesting financing for a reasonably priced vehicle. The loan request is for 64% of the total vehicle cost, supported by a significant total deposit (36% of the Goods Cost). No \"smell test\" issues were observed.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n1. **Credit Risk**:\n   - Verified against \"Credit Tiers\" policy.\n   - Applicant's credit score of 731 places them in Tier A (Prime).\n   - No issues identified in this category.\n   \n2. **Asset & Loan Structure**:\n   - LTV Calculation:\n     - Advance = $27,381, Trade Price = $40,283, resulting in an LTV of **67.97%**.\n     - Verified against \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV.\" Policy caps LTV at 110% for Tier A.\n     - No issues identified. Reported as Low Severity Finding for transparency.\n   - Vehicle Conditions:\n     - Verified against \"Maximum Age at Start (8 years)\" and \"Maximum Age at End (12 years)\".\n     - The proposed vehicle (2019 model year) and 36-month term meet policy requirements.\n     - Mileage of 48,024 is well below the maximum allowable 100,000 miles.\n     - No issues identified in this category.\n   \n3. **Affordability**:\n   - DTI Calculation:\n     - Net income = $5,292, Proposed Monthly Instalment = $400.\n     - Calculated DTI = 8%, which is much lower than Tier A threshold (45%).\n   - Verified against \"DTI Thresholds.\" No issues; reported as Low Severity Finding for record.\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- The absence of a credit report remains a **Critical Issue** and precludes an accurate evaluation of the applicantâ€™s risk profile.\n- Besides this, all parameters such as credit score, LTV, DTI ratio, and vehicle criteria align well with underwriting policies for Tier A applicants under Prime categorization. There are no smaller or compounding risks that otherwise suggest the proposal is unsound.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- A critical barrier exists due to the missing credit report. The absence of this essential document prevents evaluation of potential risks like prior defaults, fraud warnings, or aggressive credit-seeking behavior.\n- Without this, the proposal remains incomplete and cannot be approved.\n\n**Final Statement:** TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
