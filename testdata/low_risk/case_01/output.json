    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThe credit report is unavailable, which critically impacts the ability to perform data verification and analyze the applicant's credit risk. A `Critical` severity finding has been raised for this missing component.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nA \"gut check\" based on the available data reveals no significant concerns. The applicant's income seems consistent with the advance requested, and the vehicle's cost aligns with their stated monthly income. However, due to the lack of credit report information, vital details about their financial behavior and risk cannot be assessed.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nMoving on to policy verification for whatever can be checked:\n\n1. **Credit Risk:** A critical finding has already been raised due to the lack of a credit score, so no further evaluation in this area is possible.\n\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure:**\n   - **Vehicle Age and Mileage:** The vehicle is from 2019 with 48,024 miles. I need to verify if it meets our policy standards for such factors.\n   - **LTV Calculation:** I will calculate the Loan-to-Value ratio and compare it to policy guidelines.\n\n3. **Affordability:**\n   - Assessing Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios based on provided financials to check if the instalments are within acceptable thresholds. Current obligations cannot be calculated due to the absence of credit report details.\n\nI will now proceed to calculate LTV and perform policy lookups.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (continued)\n\nThe vehicle and loan structure meet policy requirements:\n\n1. **Vehicle Age Compliance**  \n   The vehicle is 4 years old at the start and will be 7 years old at the end of the term, complying with the maximum age limits (8 years at start, 12 years at end). This has been flagged as a `Low` severity finding with no required action.\n\n2. **Vehicle Mileage**  \n   With a mileage of 48,024, the vehicle is well within the allowable limit of 100,000 miles. This has also been identified as a `Low` severity finding with no further action.\n\n3. **Loan-to-Value Compliance**  \n   The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio calculated is 67.97%, significantly below the maximum of 110% for a Tier A applicant. This has been flagged as a `Low` severity finding confirming compliance.\n\n4. **DTI Compliance**  \n   I will now calculate the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio to assess affordability limits.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (continued)\n\n**DTI Ratio Compliance**  \nThe calculated DTI ratio is just 2%, which is exceptionally low and well within the maximum allowable threshold of 45% for a Tier A applicant. This has been flagged as a `Low` severity finding confirming strong affordability.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nTaking a holistic view of the proposal:\n\n1. The missing credit report constitutes a major hindrance to assessing the applicant's overall financial stability, reported as a `Critical` finding.\n2. All other evaluated factors suggest that this proposal is compliant with existing policies, showcasing affordability and appropriate loan structure. However, this cannot mitigate the primary issue caused by the absence of the credit report.\n\nThe lack of credit report data remains the single critical barrier to proceeding with this application.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nTo summarize:\n- A `Critical` issue was identified concerning the missing credit report, rendering further creditworthiness analysis impossible.\n- All other fields analyzed—such as LTV ratio, DTI ratio, vehicle age, and mileage—meet underwriting standards.\n\nThe missing credit report remains a critical gap that must be resolved before moving forward.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
