    "reasoning": "### Review Summary:\n\nI have carefully examined the proposal and performed the following steps to assess its suitability for finance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1.1 **Data Verification**: Skipped due to the unavailability of the applicant’s credit report.\n- **Critical Finding**: The absence of a credit report prevents verification of the applicant’s credit history, any potential negative indicators, or fraud markers. This is a deal-breaking issue as per standard underwriting practices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe application, based on the given data, appears generally reasonable. The requested loan amount, annual income, and vehicle valuation align to an extent, but feasibility cannot be comprehensively confirmed due to missing credit data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n3.1 **Credit Risk**:\n   - The applicant’s stated credit score is **619**, which falls into Credit Tier C (sub-prime). As per section 2.1 of the policy, stricter lending criteria apply.\n   - Additional scrutiny is required for affordability and the deposit requirement.\n\n3.2 **Asset & Loan Structure**:\n   - **Vehicle Compliance**:\n     - The vehicle meets policy requirements for age (6 years in 2025, 11 years at the end of the loan term) and initial mileage (48,024 miles). No violations detected here.\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n     - Calculated LTV is **67.97%**, which is well below the maximum allowable 95% for Tier C applicants.\n   - **Loan Term**:\n     - The loan duration is **72 months**, which exceeds the policy’s maximum allowable term of **60 months** for any agreement, as per section 4.3. This represents a violation.\n   - **Minimum Deposit**:\n     - The Goods Cost is **42,757**, and the required minimum deposit for Tier C is 10% ((42,757 x 10%) = 4,276).\n     - The applicant has provided a cash + part exchange deposit of **15,376**, which exceeds the minimum deposit requirement.\n\n3.3 **Affordability (DTI) Analysis**:\n   - Calculated DTI is **2%**, which is far below the maximum allowable DTI of **35%** for Tier C applicants, as per section 3.1. This aspect is compliant with the policy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining the findings:\n1. **Major concern**: Missing credit report data represents a critical gap and must be resolved before moving forward.\n2. **Strength**: The applicant's significant deposit contribution and low LTV ratio indicate a lower financial risk concerning the asset and loan amount.\n3. **Weakness 1**: The applicant's credit score positions them in Tier C, indicating a higher overall risk level.\n4. **Weakness 2**: The loan term is **72 months**, exceeding the policy’s maximum of 60 months. This needs to be addressed, as it violates the underwriting policy rules.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion\n1. This proposal cannot proceed due to the **Critical finding:** Missing credit report.\n2. Should the credit report be provided and found acceptable, the following must be considered:\n   - Adjust the loan term to comply with the 60-month maximum regulation.\n   - Assess affordability holistically, considering the applicant's credit risk and current income.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
