    "reasoning": "Since the credit report is not available, I am unable to complete Step 1 (Data Verification & Credit Analysis). I will now proceed to Step 2: Initial Sanity Check.\n\n### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- The requested loan amount is £27,381 with a monthly instalment of £400. The applicant has a high stated monthly income of £20,292 per month, which seems reasonable to cover the instalments.\n- The retail price of the vehicle (£42,757) in relation to the applicant’s stated income is substantial. However, with a large total deposit (£15,376), this proportion becomes less concerning.\n- Overall, the initial assessment indicates that the deal appears somewhat reasonable despite the lack of the credit report. However, the missing credit report remains a critical limitation for the evaluation.\n\n### **Next Step: Detailed Policy Verification**\nTo proceed, I need to validate the proposal against the company’s policy regarding credit tiers, vehicle criteria and LTV, and affordability.\n\n1. **Credit Risk**: Policy check for Credit Tiers (applicant credit score of 600).\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure**: Policy check for Vehicle Criteria, LTV ratio, and loan term.\n3. **Affordability**: Policy check for DTI thresholds (debt-to-income ratio).\n\nI will perform these checks in parallel using the tools.### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n\n#### **3a. Credit Risk**\n- The applicant's credit score is **600**, placing them in **Tier C (Sub-Prime)** according to the policy’s credit tiers.\n- This tier indicates stricter lending criteria, including the importance of ensuring minimum deposit and extra diligence in affordability checks.\n\n#### **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n\n**Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n- The calculated LTV is **67.97%**.\n- Policy for Tier C restricts the LTV to a maximum of **95%**.\n- The LTV of 67.97% is **within policy limits**.\n\n**Vehicle Requirements and Term:**\n- The vehicle was manufactured in **2019**, making it 6 years old at the start of the loan.\n- The term is 60 months, meaning the vehicle would be **11 years** old at the end of the agreement.\n- Both the age at the start (max 8 years) and age at the end (max 12 years) are **in policy limits**.\n- The current mileage is **48,024 miles** and is **well below the maximum** limit of **100,000 miles**.\n\n**Minimum Deposit Requirement (Tier C):**\n- The vehicle’s Goods Cost is **£42,757**.\n- The policy requires a **minimum cash deposit of 10% for Tier C**, which translates to £4,276. \n- The cash deposit provided is **£5,226**, which **meets the minimum requirement**.\n\n#### **3c. Affordability**\n\n**Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**\n- The total monthly credit commitments reported is **zero**, while the proposed monthly instalment is **£400**. Given a stated monthly income of **£20,292**, the DTI is calculated as **2%**.\n- The maximum allowable DTI for Tier C is **35%**, meaning that the calculated DTI is comfortably within the acceptable range.\n\n### Findings\n1. **Credit Tier Verification**\n    - Applicable Credit Tier: **C**\n    - LTV is well within the max limits for Tier C.\n    - Vehicle criteria (age, mileage) and term length comply with the policy.\n\n2. **Affordability Criteria**\n    - DTI (2%) is extremely low compared to the maximum allowable for Tier C (35%).\n\n### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- Despite the credit report being unavailable (critical issue), the data within the proposal does not present independent affordability or asset-related risks. There are no additional concerns or issues that arise from a synthesis of the findings. However, the lack of a credit report remains an unresolved critical factor that must be addressed before proceeding.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nHaving completed the review, I identified one critical finding (missing credit report) that prevents further approval of this application. While the proposal indicates compliance with other underwriting policies, the missing credit report is crucial for assessing creditworthiness and compliance with the company’s policies comprehensively. Therefore, I recommend deferring decision-making until a credit report is obtained or undertaking further investigations as appropriate.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
