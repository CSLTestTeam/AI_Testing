    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification and Credit Analysis\n- **1a: Verify Data Integrity**: Skipped, as the credit report is missing.\n- **1b: Analyze Credit Risk**: Skipped for the same reason—no credit report is available. I have flagged this as a critical issue.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nWhile the credit report was unavailable, certain aspects of the proposal warrant scrutiny:\n1. **Applicant's Financial Profile**: With a stated monthly income of £20,292 and a credit score of **560**, the affordability and the applicant's repayment ability must be verified further.\n2. **Vehicle Acquisition**: The application is for a **2022 Honda Jazz** retailing at **£42,757**. This price is very high for this type of vehicle model, which is typically less expensive. This mismatch suggests the possibility of inflated vehicle pricing or inaccurate information. I'll revisit vehicle price assessment during policy checks.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nI will now work through specific policy checks:\n\n#### 3a: Credit Risk\nThe applicant's credit score is **560**. I will look up the corresponding minimum requirements for credit tier eligibility.### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Analysis\nThe calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio was determined to be **67.97%**. According to Section 4.1 of the policy manual:\n- For Credit Tier **C**, the maximum allowable LTV is **95%**.\n\nThus, the proposal passes the LTV requirement.\n\n### Debt-to-Income (DTI) Inquiry\nI will now calculate the Debt-to-Income ratio based on the provided financial data. Based on the policy, the DTI cannot exceed 35% for Credit Tier C applicants.Continuing the analysis:\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n1. The applicant falls into Tier C due to their low credit score of **560**, requiring strict lending terms. This includes a **mandatory 10% minimum cash deposit** and stricter limitations on affordability and asset-related thresholds.\n2. The vehicle mileage far exceeds the policy limit of **100,000 miles**, which is a **hard rule** in the underwriting policy.\n3. Additional discrepancies include:\n   - **The LTV ratio was calculated as 67.97%**, which falls below the Tier C maximum (95%). No issues with LTV were identified.\n   - Absence of the credit report poses a significant risk as it eliminates the underwriter's ability to comprehensively verify the applicant's credit history, debt obligations, or other financial behavior factors.\n  \nOverall, the missing credit report and vehicle mileage render this application nearly untenable, even after adjustments.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThis deal cannot proceed without resolving the critical issues related to the credit report being lacking (‘Critical risk’ also generatable) rental replacement preferable renting unit etc"
