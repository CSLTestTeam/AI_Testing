    ],
    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1a. **Verify Data Integrity**  \nI skipped this step because the credit report data is entirely missing, as per the `creditReportJson`. A critical finding has been reported.\n\n1b. **Analyze Credit Risk**  \nThis step is also skipped due to the lack of credit report data. A reliable risk analysis cannot be conducted without credit data.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nI proceeded with a preliminary assessment of the proposal details.\n\n1. The applicant has a low credit score of 560, which is concerning and could imply financial distress or past credit issues.\n2. The stated monthly income is unusually high at £20,292, which merits further scrutiny.\n3. The requested advance of £27,381 seems reasonable relative to the cost of the vehicle, but the absence of a credit report hampers adequate context, such as assessing existing debts or verifying income claims.\n\nThis step generally raises potential concerns, but a full explanation must be deferred until policy checks are done.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nNext, I proceeded with detailed policy verifications for credit risk, vehicle criteria, LTV, and affordability.\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\nSince we cannot rely on the credit report to validate the credit score or identify potential red flags like defaults, I have flagged the absence of the credit report.\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure Validation\nThree checks were performed:\n1. Loan-To-Value (LTV): Calculated and assessed against policy.\n2. Vehicle Age & Mileage: Analyzed for acceptable limits.\n3. Loan Term: Ensuring compliance with the maximum allowable term.\n\n#### 3c. Affordability (DTI Calculation)\nUsed inputs from the stated values of monthly income and the proposed monthly instalment to calculate DTI and compare it against policy.\n\nLet me initiate the policy checks, LTV, and DTI calculations simultaneously.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\n- **Credit Score Below Tier Minimum**  \n  - **Findings:** The applicant's credit score of 560 is below the threshold for Tier B, which requires a score of 620 or higher. This score places the applicant in Tier C (550-619), which has stricter lending criteria.\n  - **Policy Reference:** Section 2.1, Credit Tiers; Applicants in Tier C must meet stricter conditions like higher deposit requirements and lower LTV limits.\n  - **Action:** Enforce Tier C requirements for the applicant, including a minimum cash deposit of 10% of the vehicle's cost (already met in this case).\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure Validation\n1. **Loan-To-Value (LTV) Ratio**  \n   - **Calculated LTV:** 67.97%  \n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 4.1, Loan-to-Value  \n   - **Findings:** The calculated LTV ratio falls within the allowable 95% threshold for Tier C.\n   - **Action:** Ensure the application is evaluated under Tier C conditions as per the credit score.\n\n2. **Vehicle Age and Mileage**  \n   - **Results:** The vehicle is 3 years old (2022 model year) with 48,024 miles at the start of the agreement.\n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 4.2, Vehicle Criteria  \n   - **Findings:** The vehicle's age and mileage are within policy limits (≤8 years old and ≤100,000 miles).\n   - **Action:** No further action required; the vehicle qualifies.\n\n3. **Loan Term**  \n   - **Loan Term:** 36 months  \n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 4.3, Term Lengths  \n   - **Findings:** The loan term is compliant, as it is well within the maximum 60 months limit for vehicles under 5 years old.\n   - **Action:** No further action required.\n\n#### 3c. Affordability\n- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**  \n  - **Calculated DTI:** 2%  \n  - **Policy Reference:** Section 3.1, DTI Thresholds  \n  - **Findings:** The applicant’s DTI is significantly below the 35% cap for Tier C.\n  - **Action:** No further action required as the DTI is satisfactory.\n\nWhile the affordability and loan structure parameters of the proposal meet underwriting policies, the credit score falls within Tier C, necessitating stricter consideration (e.g., higher cash deposit, strict verification of affordability via consistent payslips).\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nWhile individual findings indicate that the proposal is within policy, the following synthesized factors are noteworthy:\n1. The absence of credit report data prevents proper validation of financial behavior and the applicant's reliability. This is a critical ongoing issue.\n2. The stated income of £20,292 per month seems disproportionately high for a stated employment duration of seven months and position as a Technical Lead. This potential inconsistency merits review and verification through valid documentation.\n3. The calculated DTI provides assurance of affordability based only on stated income. However, the lack of verification with documented evidence introduces uncertainty.\n\nGiven these synthesized concerns, I recommend this deal not proceed until the credit report is obtained and clarification on the income discrepancy is resolved.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Your Review\nI have methodically reviewed the available data from the proposal and referred to the underwriting manual to ensure all criteria are assessed.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
