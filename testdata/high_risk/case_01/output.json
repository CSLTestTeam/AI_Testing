    "reasoning": "### Summary of Findings:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- Skipped due to lack of a credit report, which was reported as a critical finding.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- All data aligns with stated values.\n\n#### Findings Reported:\n1. **Credit Report Missing (Critical)**:\n   - No credit report was provided for the applicant.\n   - A credit report is critical to assess a borrower's financial health.\n   - Recommendation: Reject or request a detailed credit report.\n\n2. **Credit Score in Tier C (Medium)**:\n   - Current Value: 560\n   - Tier C (550–619) requires stricter lending criteria.\n   - Recommendation: Proceed with Tier C policies.\n\n3. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio (Low)**:\n   - LTV evaluated as 67.97%, within threshold for Tier C (maximum allowed: 95%).\n   - No immediate action required.\n\n4. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio (Low)**:\n   - DTI evaluated as 2%, well below Tier C maximum limit of 35%.\n   - No immediate action required.\n\n5. **Applicant's Employment Duration (Medium)**:\n   - Current employment tenure: 7 months.\n   - Short employment history may indicate income instability.\n   - Recommendation: Verify employment and income stability.\n\n6. **Vehicle Age Compliance (Low)**:\n   - Vehicle year is 2022, and it conforms to age limits per policy.\n   - No action needed.\n\n### Holistic Synthesis\nWhile the LTV and DTI ratios meet the policy criteria and the vehicle age is within policy limits, the lack of a credit report makes it impossible to adequately evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness. Additionally, the applicant’s short employment duration adds to concerns about income stability, particularly as their credit score indicates higher risk.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Obtain the missing credit report immediately for a comprehensive risk assessment.\n2. Consider verifying the applicant’s employment details to confirm stability and income.\n3. Evaluate additional risk factors (if uncovered after obtaining the credit report).\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
