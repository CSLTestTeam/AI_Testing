        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "### Steps Taken and Findings:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Credit Report Unavailability** - The credit report for the applicant is completely missing. This cannot be overlooked and was flagged as a **Critical** issue since we cannot assess the applicant's creditworthiness without this critical information.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Given that the customer's stated income is £20,292 per month and their credit score is at 599 (Tier C as per policy), there is a significant mismatch in their stated high income and sub-prime credit score. This raises questions about the accuracy of the income stated; however, since income verification normally requires comparing with payslips or other documentation, and none were provided, further action should be taken to validate this information manually.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Tier and Credit Score** (Policy Section 2.1 Credit Tiers):\n   - The applicant's credit score of 599 categorizes them as Tier C (Sub-Prime), which requires stricter lending criteria.\n   - Finding: Applicant does not meet the 620+ credit score for Tier B.\n   - Finding Severity: **Medium**\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)** (Policy Section 4.1 Loan-to-Value):\n   - The LTV ratio calculation shows a value of **67.97%**, which is compliant for Tier C, as it is below the 95% limit outlined in Section 4.1.\n   - Finding: LTV does not violate policy but should be assessed alongside other Tier C requirements. \n   - Finding Severity: **Medium**\n\n3. **Deposit Requirements for Tier C** (Policy Section 4.4 Minimum Deposit):\n   - The policy requires applicants in Tier C to provide a **minimum cash deposit of 10%**, which amounts to **£4,275.70** (10% of £42,757 Goods Cost). However, the applicant has provided only £70 in total deposit (inclusive of £50 for part exchange), which is approximately 0.16%, far below the required benchmark.\n   - Finding: Deposit requirements are **not met** according to policy Section 4.4.\n   - Finding Severity: **High**\n\n4. **Vehicle Criteria** (Policy Section 4.2 Vehicle Criteria):\n   - **Age at Start of Agreement:** This is within the allowable maximum (8 years). The vehicle, a 2019 Honda Jazz, has an age of **6 years** at the proposal start date.\n   - **Age at End of Agreement:** At the end of the proposed 3-year term, the vehicle will be **9 years old**, which meets the policy's maximum age criteria of 12 years.\n   - **Mileage:** The vehicle's reported mileage stands at **48,024 miles**, comfortably below the 100,000-mile cap.\n   - **Category Status:** It is not specified if the vehicle has been written off (Category S/N). Assuming compliance unless otherwise noted.\n\n   - Finding: No issues identified.\n\n5. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** (Policy Section 3.1 DTI Thresholds):\n   - Calculated DTI: **2%** (under allowable threshold for Tier C of 35% as per policy).\n   - Finding: No issues identified.\n\n6. **Loan Term** (Policy Section 4.3 Term Length):\n   - Loan Term: **3 years (36 months)** is compliant, as it is below the maximum of 48 months for a vehicle over 5 years old.\n   - Finding: No issues identified.\n\n7. **Income Verification** (Policy Section 3.2 Income Verification):\n   - Verification of the applicant's stated income could not be performed due to missing payslips or other employer-provided documentation. This is crucial given the stated income is substantially high (£20,292 monthly) and raises concerns of potential misrepresentation.\n   - Finding: This raises concerns that should be addressed manually before proceeding.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The combination of a sub-prime credit score, insufficient deposit percentage that violates Tier C requirements, and missing income verification documentation presents a high level of cumulative risk. Without further data clarification (e.g., payslips, or fraud marker checks), the deal appears unsuitable under existing policy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMy comprehensive analysis has uncovered several issues, most notably the **critical absence of the applicant's credit report**, as well as a **high-severity breach of minimum deposit requirements for Tier C**. Other structural factors, such as LTV and term length, are compliant, but the lack of documented income verification exacerbates an already high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Recommendation:\nReject the application due to insufficient compliance with policy requirements and lack of critical information for creditworthiness assessment.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
