    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Analysis Summary:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **No Credit Report Available**: The absence of a credit report is a critical issue, as it prevents verification of the applicant's financial health, credit risk factors, and fraud markers. This has been reported as a critical finding.\n- **Step 1 Skipped** due to unavailability of a credit report.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The monthly income appears to be unusually high for an average technical lead occupation, but the lack of a credit report prevents validation. This point cannot be analyzed further, but no immediate \"smell test\" failure is evident otherwise.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **LTV Calculation (Vehicle Criteria)**:\n  - Calculated LTV: **67.97%**, which complies with Tier C requirements (maximum is 95%). A medium-severity finding was reported for clarification.\n- **Vehicle Age and Mileage**:\n  - Vehicle age at start: **6 years**; vehicle age at end of term: **9 years**, satisfying the policy limit of **12 years maximum**.\n  - Mileage: **48,024 miles**, satisfying the maximum allowed mileage of **100,000 miles**.\n- **Term Length**:\n  - Proposal term: **36 months**, well within the maximum limit of **48 months** for vehicles over 5 years old.\n- **Minimum Deposit Requirement**:\n  - Total deposit provided is **35.96% of the Goods Cost**, easily exceeding the **10% minimum requirement** for Tier C applicants.\n- **DTI Calculation (Affordability)**:\n  - DTI: **2%**, significantly below Tier C's maximum requirement of **35%**. Reported as a low-severity finding confirming compliance.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The absence of a credit report is the most substantial issue, preventing verification of key factors for a prudent underwriting decision. Without it, the applicant's financial risk profile remains unknown.\n- No other combinations of issues were identified; the rest of the proposal generally aligns with policy.\n\n### Final Assessment\nThe proposal complies with major vehicle criteria, affordability, and LTV requirements; however, the lack of a credit report makes it risky to assess the applicant's actual creditworthiness or identify potential financial red flags. This warrants a critical finding and follow-up before any underwriting decision is made.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
