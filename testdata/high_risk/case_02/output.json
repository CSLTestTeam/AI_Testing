    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Step 1 is skipped** as the credit report is unavailable. Reported this as a critical finding because it prevents conducting the prescribed detailed credit analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nI verified the following:\n- The applicant (Credit Score: 560, Tier C) is applying for a reasonably priced vehicle (£42,757 retail price). Deposit structure seems acceptable.\n- However, the affordability issue (DTI = 435%) represents a major discrepancy that undermines the plausibility of the loan structure.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk Assessment**:\n   - Policy establishes a credit score range of 550-619 for Tier C eligibility, and the applicant meets it. However, they are far below Tier B thresholds (620+). Reported as a medium-severity finding.\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure**:\n   - LTV calculated at 67.97%, well within the 95% limit for Tier C applicants. No issues found here.\n   - Vehicle age: The policy allows a maximum of 8 years at agreement start and 12 years at term end. This vehicle (2019 model) meets these criteria. Reported as low-severity.\n   - Cash deposit: Applicant exceeded the required 10% minimum deposit, offering 12.2% of the Goods Cost. Reported as low-severity.\n3. **Affordability**:\n   - DTI ratio of 435% is calculated, exceeding the 35% cap for Tier C applicants by a significant margin. This is a critical issue and indicates the applicant cannot meet their financial obligations if the loan is approved.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining all findings:\n- The missing credit report (critical) heavily diminishes underwriting confidence.\n- The extreme DTI ratio (435%) is unsustainable and raises significant concerns about the applicant's ability to repay.\n- While the vehicle and LTV meet criteria and there is a favorable cash deposit, these do not outweigh the affordability and missing credit report issues.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAnalysis of all the proposal's data against policy and detected findings leads to the strong conclusion that this application is high risk and unviable for financing under current terms. Multiple critical findings were identified.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
