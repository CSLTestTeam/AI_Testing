    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Critical Finding:** No credit report was provided for this proposal, which prevents analysis of the applicant's financial health and creditworthiness. This issue was flagged as critical, requiring a credit report before further evaluation.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The deal seems operationally possible with no glaring issues, but the absence of the credit report limits a complete analysis of financial behavior. The Loan Advance and monthly commitments do not indicate any red flags at a top-level view. However, lacking credit information hinders the usual sanity judgment.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n#### **3a. Credit Risk**\n- **Medium Finding:** The applicant's credit score of 574 places them in Tier C. This tier requires compliance with stricter criteria, including affordability checks (such as DTI) and higher down payments as per policy.\n\n#### **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Calculated to be 67.97%. This complies with Tier C, which allows an LTV maximum of up to 95%. No issue was identified.\n- **Vehicle Age:** The vehicle is a 2017 model, making it 8 years old as of 2025. Upon adding the term of the agreement (5 years or 60 months), the vehicle would be 12 years old at the end of the agreement. This complies with the policy limit of 12 years maximum age at the end of term.\n- **Term Lengths:** The term of 60 months (5 years) complies with the limit for the age of the vehicle. No issue was identified.\n- **Mileage:** The vehicle has 48,024 miles as of the start of the agreement, which is well below the permissible 100,000 miles. No issue noted.\n\n#### **3c. Affordability (Debt-to-Income Ratio)**\n- **DTI Ratio:** This is calculated as 2%, which is well below the Tier C limit of 35%. No issue noted.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The absence of a critical credit report is a severe limiting factor, but based on the available proposal data and the applied policies:\n  * The applicant's credit score just meets the Tier C requirement (550-619).\n  * Both LTV and DTI metrics comfortably fall within limits for Tier C applicants.\n  * The vehicle's age, mileage, and loan term comply with policy.\n  Despite these being individual compliance metrics, the higher likelihood of risk usually associated with Tier C applicants, coupled with the absence of a credit report, necessitates caution.\n\n### Step 5: Triage Conclusion\nSteps followed:\n1. Verified the credit report. Raised a critical finding because no credit report exists.\n2. Checked the overall deal for basic reasonability. The figures largely align.\n3. Checked the credit tier (flagged Tier C classification), asset & loan rules (all compliant), and affordability (verified DTI falls below 35% for Tier C).\n4. Synthesized the findings. The key risk includes the missing credit report and Tier C-associated risks requiring higher scrutiny.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
