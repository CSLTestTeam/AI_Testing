    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Review\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Credit Report Unavailability**: The credit report for this applicant is not available, which is a critical issue. It restricts the evaluation of the applicant's creditworthiness, negative factors such as defaults, high credit utilization, or credit-seeking behavior. This significantly impairs the risk assessment process.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The loan amount of $27,381 is within reasonable limits, given the vehicle's retail price ($42,757) and the total deposit ($15,376). The stated monthly income of $20,292 is substantially higher than the average, which also supports affordability. However, the applicant's credit score (618) categorizes them as Tier C, necessitating additional scrutiny.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **Credit Tier Determination**: Based on Policy Section 2.1, the applicant's credit score of 618 places them in Credit Tier C. This tier necessitates stricter conditions, including a minimum 10% cash deposit of the vehicle Goods Cost, stricter DTI thresholds, and LTV evaluations.\n    - Reported Finding: Credit Score falls below Tier B, categorized as Tier C. Severity: Medium.\n\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n    - **GoodsCost**: $42,757\n    - **Advances**: $27,381\n    - **TradePrice**: $40,283\n    - Calculated LTV is 67.97%.\n    - According to policy, the maximum allowable LTV for applicants in Tier C is 95%. The calculated LTV value complies with this policy.\n    - Reported Finding: LTV check passes for Tier C. Severity: Low.\n\n- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**:\n    - **Verified Income**: $20,292 (Stated in the application; income verification document is missing due to absence of credit report).\n    - **Proposed Instalment**: $400.\n    - **Calculated DTI**: 2%, which is far below the maximum limit for Tier C applicants (35%). The loan is clearly affordable based on stated income.\n    - Reported Finding: DTI ratio is well within acceptable levels for Tier C. Severity: Low.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nWhile the DTI and LTV checks are favorable for this proposal under Tier C guidelines, the absence of the credit report is a significant limitation. Without the credit report, key factors such as negative credit behaviors and search history cannot be analyzed. Additionally, the recent duration of employment (only 7 months with the current employer) would typically warrant cautious consideration. However, the strong affordability metrics somewhat mitigate this risk.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\n- The proposal appears affordable based on the stated income and calculated metrics such as DTI and LTV.\n- However, the missing credit report constitutes a critical risk as it prevents proper evaluation of the applicant's creditworthiness.\n- The applicantâ€™s placement in Tier C necessitates stricter evaluation.\n- Stricter affordability checks should also include a review of income verification (e.g., payslips) before proceeding.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
