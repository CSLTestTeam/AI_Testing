    "reasoning": "### Summary of Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Skipped because the credit report was not available.\n2. **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped due to absence of credit report information.\n\nCritical issue reported regarding the missing credit report. Proceeding to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nReviewing deal figures:\n- **Income:** The applicant has stated a high monthly income of £20,292.\n- **Vehicle:** This is a mid-tier priced vehicle at £42,757 retail, which aligns with stated income.\n- **Loan Amount:** The advance is £27,381, which appears moderate when compared to total vehicle cost and stated income.\n\nNo initial \"smell test\" failures were observed.\n\n---\n\n### Proceeding to Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification (The \"Science\")\nWill now query the underwriting policy and perform checks on:\n1. Applicant's credit score tier.\n2. Vehicle age, mileage, Retail Price, and Loan-to-Value ratio.\n3. Debt-to-Income ratio.\n\nThis process involves multiple calculations and policy lookups. Initiating...After reviewing the policy documents and performing the Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Debt-to-Income (DTI) calculations, the following findings are applicable:\n\n### 3a: Credit Risk Validation\n1. **Credit Tier Evaluation**:\n   - Applicant's credit score: 618, which places them in **Tier C (Sub-Prime)** based on the policy.\n\n   **Findings Report:**\n   - Credit score is valid, but it's at the very low end of the *Tier C (acceptable but sub-prime)* range.\n\n### 3b: Asset & Loan Structure Validation\n1. **Maximum Vehicle Age at Start of Agreement:** \n   - Vehicle Age: 4 years (2019 against year 2025).\n   - Acceptable Limit: Max age at agreement start is 8 years.\n   - **Finding:** Compliant.\n   \n2. **Maximum Vehicle Age at End of Agreement:**  \n   - Vehicle Age at end of the 3-year (36 months) term: 7 years.\n   - Acceptable Limit: Max 12 years at end of agreement.\n   - **Finding:** Compliant.\n\n3. **Maximum Mileage:**  \n   - Vehicle mileage: 48,024 miles.\n   - Acceptable Limit: 100,000 miles.\n   - **Finding:** Compliant.\n   \n4. **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):**  \n   - LTV Calculated from policy: **(Advance £27,381 / Trade Price £40,283) x 100 = 67.97%.**\n   - Allowable LTV for Tier C: **95% of trade price**.\n   - **Finding:** Well within thresholds. Compliant.\n\n5. **Minimum Cash Deposit for Tier C:**  \n   - Minimum required: 10% of vehicle retail price £42,757 = £4,275.70.\n   - Cash deposit provided: £5,226.\n   - **Finding:** Compliant, and the deposit exceeds the minimum required, mitigating risk to some extent.\n\n6. **Maximum Loan Term:**  \n   - Proposed term: 36 months (3 years).\n   - Maximum allowable term for vehicle aged 4 years at agreement start: **48 months**.\n   - **Finding:** Compliant.\n\n### 3c: Affordability Validation (Debt-to-Income Ratio - DTI)\n1. **DTI Calculation:**\n   - Total Monthly Commitments: £0 (no disclosed commitments).\n   - Proposed Monthly Instalment: £400.\n   - Net Monthly Income: £20,292.\n   - **DTI = ((£0 + £400) / £20,292) x 100 = 2%.**\n   - Maximum allowable DTI for Tier C: **35%**.\n   - **Finding:** Well below threshold.\n\n### Combined Compliance Risks\nThus far:\n- The applicant meets compliance thresholds for vehicle condition, LTV, Deposit, Loan Term, and DTI.\n- A critical gap persists due to missing credit report data, as this leaves creditworthiness unverifiable.\n  \nMoving forward to the final synthesis in Step 4.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis (The \"Art\")\nUpon synthesis of findings:\n1. **Strengths:**\n   - The applicant demonstrates good affordability, with an extremely low DTI ratio of just 2%.\n   - LTV ratio stands at 67.97%, well below Tier C's maximum permitted limit of 95%.\n   - The vehicle's age and mileage align with underwriting policy requirements, and the loan term is also appropriate.\n   - The cash deposit surpasses the minimum 10% threshold for Tier C, potentially offsetting some risk associated with the applicant's credit profile.\n\n2. **Weaknesses:**\n   - The applicant's credit score of 618 is only two points above the cutoff for Tier C. It is crucial to assess the specific reasons for the low credit score, an evaluation that was not possible due to the missing credit report.\n   - While the credit tier is technically compliant, the absence of a credit report creates a substantial gap in verifying the creditworthiness of the applicant and evaluating the overall financial risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the financial ratios, vehicle details, and deposit size point to an acceptable risk level, the lack of a credit report and the low credit score raise concerns. Further investigation or submission of the credit report is strongly advised to make a fully informed underwriting decision.\n\n### Final Step 5: Concluding the Triage\nSteps Taken:\n1. Performed data integrity and credit analysis (skipped due to missing credit report; critical finding reported).\n2. Conducted an initial sanity check of key financial aspects (no \"smell test\" issue found).\n3. Verified compliance with underwriting policies (reported one medium-severity and one critical issue).\n4. Synthesized findings to provide a holistic perspective (balance of risk factors).\n5. Final recommendation: Request missing credit report for comprehensive risk assessment; otherwise, consider declining.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
