    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n**Data Verification Steps:**\n- I was unable to complete this step due to the missing credit report file; this was identified as a critical issue, as a credit report is essential for essential validations of credit score, credit history, account handling, and any fraud indicators. **Reported this as a critical finding.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Despite the lack of a credit report, the proposal data provided a credit score of **665**, which would place the applicant in Tier B (per policy). There are also no indications within the provided proposal data that inherently contradict the stated credit profile. Thus, no major red flags were found here.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n**3a: Credit Risk**\n- Using the policy regarding **Credit Tiers**, validated the submitted credit score of **665**. This places the applicant in **Tier B (Near-Prime)** requiring standard financial terms and potential additional affordability checks. **Reported a Medium Severity issue** to identify this credit score category to the underwriter.\n\n**3b: Asset & Loan Structure**\n- Used the **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** policy and calculated LTV as follows:\n  - Formula: **LTV (%) = (Advance / Trade Price) × 100**\n  - Calculated LTV: (27,381 / 40,283) × 100 = **67.97%**.\n  - The policy allows up to **100% maximum for Tier B**, so this is acceptable. **Reported this as acceptable with Low Severity**.\n- The vehicle is from the year 2019, making its current age **6 years**. With a proposed 4-year term, the vehicle age at the end of the agreement will be **10 years**.\n  - The maximum age at the end of agreements is **12 years per the policy**.\n  - The mileage of the car is **48,024 miles**, far below the maximum of **100,000 miles** at the time financing starts. This satisfies policy guidelines.\n  - The loan term requested is **48 months**, which adheres to the 60-month limit outlined in policy and is appropriate for a vehicle of this age. No issues here.\n\n**3c: Affordability**\n- The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio was calculated:\n  - Formula: **DTI (%) = (Total Monthly Commitments + Proposed Instalment) / Verified Net Monthly Income × 100**\n  - Calculation: (0 + 400) / 5,292 × 100 = **8%**.\n  - The policy allows up to **40% DTI for Tier B**, so there are no affordability concerns. **Reported this as good financial health with Low Severity**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis \nHere’s the combined risk picture:\n1. Though the **credit report is missing**, we have a stated score of **665**, which places the applicant in Tier B. This is still a potential risk, as the credit report would normally confirm the accuracy of this score.\n2. The **DTI is very favorable**, and LTV is well within safe limits for Tier B, which mitigates some credit risk.\n3. There are no red flags relating to age, mileage, or term length of the vehicle in question.\n\nHowever, with the absence of a credit report, the underwriter cannot fully assess:\n- The applicant’s full financial health (e.g., outstanding credit accounts, defaults, or missed payments).\n- History of fraud flags that could indicate potential deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a credit report, this applicant's overall financial health and credit risk categories are unverifiable, which presents a fundamental risk to underwriting standards.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion \n- After reviewing all provided information about creditworthiness, affordability, the vehicle, and the structure of the loan, no other significant risks apart from the **missing critical credit report** were identified.\n- I recommend resolving the **credit report issue first, as it is critical** before any decision can be made regarding approval. All other aspects of this proposal are compliant with lower risk.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
