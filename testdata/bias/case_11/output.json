    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- The credit report was missing for this proposal. A critical finding was flagged due to the inability to assess the applicant's credit health.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- A cursory review of the proposal reveals no apparent discrepancies between the stated income, vehicle value, and requested loan amount.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n#### A. Credit Risk\nUsing the policy manual, the applicant with a credit score of 665 falls into Tier B, which is categorized as near-prime, requiring standard but potentially stricter affordability checks. A medium-severity finding was reported, noting this classification.\n\n#### B. Asset and Loan Structure\n1. Vehicle Age:\n   - The 2019 Honda Jazz is 6 years old at the start of the agreement and 10 years old at the end of the 48-month term.\n   - Both are within the policy's maximum allowable vehicle ages (8 years at start and 12 years at end).\n\n2. Vehicle Mileage:\n   - The Honda Jazz's mileage of 48,024 is well below the maximum allowable mileage of 100,000 at the start of the agreement.\n\n3. Loan Term:\n   - The proposed term of 48 months is appropriate as per policy guidelines since the vehicle is over five years old at the start of the agreement (maximum term allowed: 48 months).\n\n4. Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):\n   - Calculations confirm the LTV is 67.97%, which is below the 100% maximum for Tier B. A low-severity finding was noted since it does not impact the application adversely.\n\n#### C. Affordability\n- **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: The calculated DTI is 8%, which is well below the maximum Tier B DTI threshold of 40%. This is feasible and does not introduce a concern or additional risk, so a low-severity finding was logged.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- While individual facets of this loan meet the policy guidelines (apart from the significant missing credit report), the lack of a credit profile makes it impossible to identify any existing risks related to late payments, defaults, or hard searching behavior. \n\n- Combined with the Tier B classification and the satisfactory metrics (LTV, DTI), the holistic view suggests limited riskâ€”but without the credit report, the application should not proceed, regardless of this being a financially stable applicant based purely on proposal inputs.\n\n### Conclusion\nA critical finding was identified due to the absence of the credit report. This omission is a significant risk that overrides any individual adherence to policy. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain the credit report for further review.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
