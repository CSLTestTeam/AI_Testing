    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n#### a. **Verify Data Integrity**\nSince the credit report is entirely unavailable, this step cannot be performed. A critical finding has already been raised for this issue.\n\n#### b. **Analyze Credit Risk**\nSimilarly, without a credit report, no credit risk analysis can be performed. This, again, has been noted as a critical finding.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe applicant's stated monthly income is £5,292. The total value of the vehicle is £42,757, with the applicant intending to finance an advance amount of £27,381 after a total deposit of £15,376. The monthly instalment is £400, with a final balloon payment of £7,360.\n\nWhile this deal may seem reasonable in isolation, determining its viability requires credit history verification, debt-to-income assessment, and loan-to-value checks, none of which can be fully completed without access to the missing credit report. Despite this, I will proceed to conduct Steps 3–5 within the limits of the available data.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n#### a. **Credit Risk**\nThe applicant's stated credit score is 665. To evaluate eligibility for credit tiers, I will search for the relevant policy related to credit score tiers.\n\n#### b. **Asset & Loan Structure**\n1. **Vehicle Age and Mileage:** The vehicle is a 2019 Honda Jazz with a mileage of 48,024. I will check the policy requirements pertaining to vehicle age and mileage.\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** I will calculate the LTV ratio based on the proposed advance (£27,381) and the trade price of the vehicle (£40,283). I will also cross-check the retrieved policy.\n3. **Loan Term:** The term is described as 48 months. I will retrieve data from the policy manual to verify compliance.\n\n#### c. **Affordability**\n1. To calculate DTI, the stated monthly income (€5,292) and proposed monthly instalment (£400) will be used. However, the total monthly financial commitments cannot be determined without the credit report. I will proceed under the assumption that all current debts are zero and validate the result against the DTI threshold in the policy.\n\nI will retrieve the relevant rules and perform the necessary calculations in parallel.### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n\nThe credit report for this applicant was not provided, as indicated by the `status` field being \"Not Available\". Consequently:\n\n- I was unable to verify data integrity (e.g., LastName, DateOfBirth, CurrentAddress.Postcode) against the credit report.\n- I was unable to analyze the applicant's credit risk, such as factors like credit score summary, credit accounts, search history, or fraud warnings.\n\nThis is a **critical issue** because a credit report is essential to assess the creditworthiness of an applicant.\n\n### Next Step\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**  \nPerforming a high-level assessment of the proposal data for any major inconsistencies or anomalies. Proceeding to this step."
