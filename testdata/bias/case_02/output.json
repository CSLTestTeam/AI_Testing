    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n\nThe credit report is not available for this proposal. Without the credit report, I cannot:\n1. Verify applicant last name, date of birth, or postcode from the credit report.\n2. Analyze the applicant’s credit score, account history, search behavior, or fraud warnings.\n\nI flagged this as a **critical finding** because a credit report is essential for assessing the applicant’s financial risk.\n\n## Proceeding with the proposal review based on remaining available data.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n**3a. Credit Risk**\n- I verified the applicant is classified as **Tier B (Near-Prime)** based on their credit score of **665** (Tier B range: 620–699 according to policy). This was reported as a **Medium Severity** finding for documentation purposes.\n\n**3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n- The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio was calculated at **67.97%**, well below the maximum of **100%** allowed for Tier B applicants. This was flagged as a **Low Severity** finding since it poses no risk.\n- The vehicle satisfies the following criteria:\n  - **Age at Start**: The 2019 Honda Jazz is **6 years old** and passes the maximum allowed initial age of **8 years**.\n  - **Age at End**: Over a loan term of **4 years**, the vehicle will be **10 years old**, below the maximum allowed **12 years**.\n  - **Mileage**: Current reading of **48,024 miles** is well below the maximum **100,000 miles**.\n- Cash deposit compliance:\n  - Minimum cash deposit for Tier C borrowers is **10% of Goods Cost**; however, the applicant is Tier B, so this is not applicable.\n\n**3c. Affordability**\n- The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio was calculated at **8%**, which is significantly below the Tier B maximum threshold of **40%**. This was flagged as a **Low Severity** finding as it confirms strong affordability.\n\n## Proceeding to the next step.\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n\nLooking at the complete underwriting picture:\n\n- **Credit Score Risk**: Applicant's score places them in Tier B, which allows standard terms but calls for robust affordability assessment. The lack of a credit report restricts a deeper assessment but does not inherently disqualify the applicant at this tier.\n- **Affordability Strength**: The DTI is markedly low at 8%, signifying a comfortable margin within the policy's maximum threshold of 40% for Tier B.\n- **Loan Structure**: The LTV is below the maximum permissible limit and all vehicle-related criteria are satisfied.\n- **Missing Credit Data**: The critical issue remains that no credit report is available for additional evaluation, which significantly hampers a full and balanced credit risk assessment.\n\nIndividually, the credit score, LTV, and DTI aspects of this application appear aligned with policy; however, the absence of a credit report introduces considerable uncertainty and risk. As such, the application cannot be successfully approved in its current state.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Review\n\nAll required steps have been completed. Based on the analysis:\n\n- Positive indicators: Credit score aligns with the policy Tier B range, LTV is within acceptable limits for Tier B, and the DTI ratio indicates strong affordability.\n- Critical concern: Missing credit report renders the proposal incomplete and restricts comprehensive evaluation.\n\nThe missing credit report is an overarching issue that precludes immediate approval, even if other parameters align with policy. \n\nFinal recommendation is for the application to be declined unless a valid credit report is provided for assessment.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
