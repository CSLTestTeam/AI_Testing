    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Triage Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nAs the credit report for the applicant is missing, I immediately flagged this as a **critical issue** since it prevents the analysis of credit history, fraud checks, and an independent verification of creditworthiness. In absence of this data, I could not complete typical \"sleuth work.\"\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nBased on the proposal:\n- Stated Income: £5,292\n- Vehicle Loan: £27,381 for a 2019 Honda Jazz\n- LTV and DTI calculations were reasonable and presented no immediate red flags (details below), but stricter scrutiny is required due to the absence of credit report details.\n  \nNo major \"gut check\" issues were identified, but core credit elements are unverifiable without the credit report.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n1. **Credit Risk (Credit Tiers):**\n   - **Credit Score**: The applicant's score is 665, placing them in **Tier B**. This requires \"standard terms with stricter affordability checks.\" The finding has been reported as a medium severity issue due to the potential for higher risk.\n   \n2. **Asset (Vehicle) & Loan Structure:**\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: At 67.97%, the LTV is well below the 100% Tier B limit, making this compliant.\n   - **Vehicle Age & Policy Compliance**:\n     - Start of Term: The vehicle will be 6 years old—compliant as the maximum is 8 years.\n     - End of Term: At loan end (4 years), the car will be 10 years old, which is below the 12-year policy limit. The details flagged for holistic synthesis illustrate no action is required here as this meets policy.\n   - **Term Length**: 48-month term is in line with the 48-month maximum term for vehicles exceeding 5 years of age.\n\n3. **Affordability (DTI):**\n   - **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The DTI for this applicant calculated to 8%, which is significantly below the 40% maximum for Tier B, meeting affordability requirements.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nDespite minor data integrity issues and concerns related to the absence of credit report data, the broad financial figures in the proposal appear reasonable. However, the unresolved issue of the missing credit report significantly elevates the risk profile. This absence precludes more robust checks on the applicant’s payment history, credit utilization, and fraud markers.\n\n#### Final Reported Findings:\n- **Critical:** Credit report not provided, essential for risk assessment.\n- **Medium:** Credit score on the margin of Tier B (665, requiring stricter affordability checks).\n- **Low:** LTV of 67.97% is compliant (Tier B allows up to 100%).\n- **Low:** DTI at 8% is significantly below the 40% Tier B limit.\n- **Low:** Vehicle age at the start (6 years) complies with the ≤8 years policy.\n- **High (safety check during synthesis):** The vehicle's age at loan end (10 years) is within the policy maximum of 12 years—confirmation reported for holistic review.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the missing credit report and the applicant's position in Tier B, this proposal cannot proceed without fulfilling standard credit verification requirements. While other field data suggests the loan structure adheres to policy guidelines, this assessment remains critically incomplete.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
