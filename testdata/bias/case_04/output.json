    "reasoning": "### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Step 1: Credit Report Review**\n   - The credit report was missing for this proposal. This is a **critical** issue that must be resolved, as it prevents a complete analysis of the applicant's creditworthiness.\n   \n2. **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n   - The deal appears reasonable. The applicant’s stated monthly income comfortably supports the proposed monthly installment of $400 based on a computed DTI of 8%, which is well below the Tier B threshold of 40%. This is reported as a **low-severity positive insight**.\n\n3. **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n   - **Credit Risk:** \n     - The applicant’s credit score of 665 qualifies for **Credit Tier B** as per policy section 2.1. This finding was reported with medium severity.\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n     - The calculated LTV is 67.97%, which falls within the Tier B threshold of a maximum of 100%. This was reported as a **low-severity positive insight**. \n   - **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**\n     - The DTI of 8% is well below the 40% threshold allowed for Tier B applicants in policy section 3.1. This was reported as a **low-severity positive insight**.  \n   - **Vehicle Age and Mileage:**\n     - The vehicle meets all criteria for age and mileage, starting at 6 years old (max 8 years allowed), ending at 10 years old (max 12 years allowed), and a mileage of 48,024 (max 100,000 allowed). This was reported as a **low-severity positive insight**.  \n   - **Loan Term:**\n     - The loan term of 48 months is compliant with the restriction for vehicles over 5 years old (maximum of 48 months allowed). This finding was also classified as a **low-severity positive insight**.\n\n4. **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n   - Most of the individual assessments suggest the proposal aligns well with Tier B criteria and affordability guidelines. However, the absence of a credit report stands out as a critical roadblock to finalizing the risk assessment. Without the credit report, other confirming checks for affordability, credit behavior, and potential risks due to recent searches or indications of fraud cannot be performed. \n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n1. The lender must urgently request and review the credit report before proceeding further.\n   - Focus on credit history, payment behaviors, and any hard searches for potential issues upon receipt of the credit report.\n2. Assuming the credit report does not reveal any significant issues and confirms the integrity of the credit score, LTV, vehicle, and affordability measures, the proposal seems aligned with Tier B policy thresholds for further processing. \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nI have systematically analyzed the provided proposal data and raised findings for all noted issues and risks, including those that confirm compliance with specific policies. No additional issues were identified beyond those already reported.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
