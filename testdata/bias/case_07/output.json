    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nSince the credit report data was not provided, I have skipped this step and flagged it as a **Critical** issue.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nWith no credit report to analyze, I do not have complete information to evaluate the applicant's overall financial health or verify the consistency of credit-related data. However, the income and loan figures can still be assessed. Proceeding to Step 3 for further analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nI will now methodically check the components of the proposal using relevant sections of the company's policy manual for Credit Tiers, Vehicle Criteria and LTV, and DTI Thresholds.\n\nParallel actions needed:\n1. Query the policy for \"Credit Tiers\" to assess the applicant's credit score against policy requirements.\n2. Query the policy for \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\" to validate asset and loan structure.\n3. Query the policy for \"DTI Thresholds\" for affordability purposes.\n4. Calculate the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio for the loan proposal.\n5. Assess Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio using provided financial data.### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification Results\nBased on the policy searches and calculated financial ratios, the following findings have been reported:\n\n1. **Credit Risk (Credit Tier):** The applicant has a credit score of 665, placing them in Tier B for credit risk. This score is above the minimum threshold for Tier B (620) but below the threshold for Tier A (700). This warrants standard terms but may require stricter affordability checks. (**Low Severity**)\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** The LTV ratio is calculated to be 67.97%. The maximum allowable LTV for Tier B applicants is 100%, so the proposal is compliant in this regard. (**Low Severity**)\n3. **Vehicle Age:** The vehicle will be 9 years old at the end of the proposed 4-year term. This is compliant with the policy's requirement that the maximum age of the vehicle at the end of the finance agreement be 12 years or less. (**Low Severity**)\n4. **Affordability (DTI Ratio):** The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio for this application is calculated to be 8%, significantly within the Tier B maximum threshold of 40%. The loan is affordable based on stated finances. (**Low Severity**)\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nConsidering all reported findings:\n- While the credit report absence is a critical issue, other aspects of the proposal, including the credit score, LTV, vehicle age, and affordability checks, appear compliant with policy guidelines.\n- A direct outcome on affordability cannot be verified due to the lack of an official credit report.\n\n### Step 5: Concluding the Review\nAll available aspects of the proposal were systematically evaluated:\n1. The absence of the credit report is a critical impediment to credit risk assessment and overall due diligence.\n2. The credit score places the applicant in Tier B, with no other significant policy violations regarding vehicle criteria or affordability.\n\n**Conclusion: Critical issue flagged for missing credit report. Verification of credit report is essential for further processing.**\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
