    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThe entire step is skipped due to the absence of a credit report. This issue has been logged as a critical finding since a credit report is essential for comprehensive risk assessment and verifying the integrity of critical data points. It also prevents analysis of the applicant's financial health, historical credit issues, and any potential risk from credit-seeking behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nDespite the lack of a credit report, based on the proposal alone:\n1. The loan amount requested (`Financials.Advance` = $27,381) appears reasonable with respect to the applicant's stated monthly income (`Applicant.StatedMonthlyIncome` = $5,292), with monthly instalments of $400 over 48 months.\n2. The chosen vehicle (`Vehicle.Make` and `Model`: Honda Jazz) aligns with the loan amount and applicant profile.\n3. The income details and employment history seem plausible.\n\nNo immediate inconsistencies or \"smell test\" failures were detected at this stage.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Policy Verification\n\n#### Step 3a: Credit Risk\nSkipping this step as well, since the absence of a credit report prohibits checking the applicant's credit score against any policy thresholds. This includes verification of the applicant qualifying for specific credit tiers based on score.\n\n#### Step 3b: Asset & Loan Structure\nTo proceed with loan-to-value verification and other asset-related policy checks, I will first retrieve the applicable policy details and calculate the Loan-to-Value ratio.\n\n#### Step 3c: Affordability\nFor DTI calculation, I will gather the applicable policy rules.### Step 3: Policy Verification (Continued)\n\n#### 3b: Asset & Loan Structure\n- **Loan-To-Value Ratio (LTV):**\n  - Calculation: Advance (£27,381) / Trade Price (£40,283) = 67.97%. \n  - Policy for \"Near-Prime\" Tier (B) states a max LTV of 100%. No issues identified.\n\nI confirmed this finding with a medium severity level as LTV compliance does not raise any concerns.\n\n#### 3c: Debt-To-Income Ratio (DTI):\n- Calculated DTI: Policy specifies:\n"
