    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThis step was skipped due to the lack of a credit report, which was flagged as a critical issue. \n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe proposal appears to have reasonable inputs. The applicant has a moderate credit score (665), and the car financed (2019 Honda Jazz) aligns with such a profile. The loan terms are generally aligned with the applicant's income and ability to pay.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n**Credit Risk (Credit Tiers)**\n- The applicant's credit score is 665, which falls into **Tier B (620–699)**.\n    - This suggests standard terms apply but stricter affordability checks may be necessary.\n    - No further issues to flag as the credit score is within the accepted range for financing.\n\n**Asset & Loan Structure**\n1. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**:\n   - Calculated LTV = 67.97%.\n   - According to policy, maximum LTV for Tier B is 100%.\n   - No issues here as 67.97% is well below this limit.\n\n2. **Vehicle Age**:\n   - Vehicle's current age at the start of the agreement: 6 years (2025 – 2019 = 6).\n   - Vehicle's age at the end of the agreement: 10 years (6 + 4 years for 48-month term).\n   - Policy states vehicles must not exceed 8 years old at the start, or 12 years by the end of the term.\n   - The vehicle meets both conditions. No issues to flag.\n\n3. **Mileage**:\n   - The vehicle's mileage is 48,024.\n   - Policy states the maximum permitted mileage is 100,000 at the start of the agreement.\n   - The vehicle meets this condition. No issues to flag.\n\n4. **Term**:\n   - Proposed term is 48 months or 4 years.\n   - Policy permits a maximum term of 60 months for a vehicle less than 5 years of age, or 48 months for a vehicle over 5 years at the start.\n   - The term adheres to the policy. No issues to flag.\n\n5. **Deposit**:\n   - Goods cost: £42,757.\n   - Total deposit: £15,376, which constitutes 35.97% of the goods cost.\n   - Policy requires a minimum cash deposit of 10% for Tier C applicants. Since the applicant is Tier B, no mandatory deposit requirements apply here.\n\n**Affordability**\n1. **Debt-To-Income (DTI)**:\n   - Calculated DTI: 8%.\n   - Policy maximum for Tier B applicants is 40%.\n   - The applicant's DTI is far below the threshold, indicating good affordability.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nDespite the critical issue of missing a credit report, the applicable data in the proposal aligns comfortably with the underwriting policy regarding vehicle age, mileage, LTV, and term length. The affordability check shows the applicant has more than sufficient income to cover the monthly instalment.\n\nHowever, due to the missing credit report, the veracity of the applicant's financial health and the absence of fraud indicators cannot be confirmed. This missing information poses a high risk for proceeding.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nSteps taken:\n1. Skipped Data Verification & Credit Analysis due to a missing credit report (Critical Issue flagged).\n2. Conducted a sanity check of key figures.\n3. Verified proposal data against the underwriting policy, including credit risk, asset/loan structure, and affordability provisions.\n4. Performed holistic synthesis of all issues and risk factors.\n\nFindings:\n- **Critical Issue**: Credit report is missing.\n- All other elements of the proposal appear compliant with policy, including LTV, DTI, and loan term conditions. The missing credit report, however, prevents full verification of creditworthiness and fraud screening.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: The application cannot proceed further until a valid credit report is obtained and reviewed thoroughly. \n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
