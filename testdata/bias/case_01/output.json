    "reasoning": "**Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n\nIn this step, I was instructed to analyze the credit report for any discrepancies and evaluate credit risk factors within. However, the credit report for this application has not been provided. As a result, I flagged this as a **Critical** finding as it prevents me from performing a proper credit analysis, which is a crucial part of underwriting.\n\nAs knowledge of the credit score summary, account history, and fraud checks is unavailable, this will have a significant impact on the ability to accurately assess risk.\n\n--\n\nNext, moving to Step 2.**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n\nAlthough the provided documentation indicates a strong monthly stated income ($5,292), the retail price of the vehicle ($42,757) seems relatively high given the applicant’s income level. This raises affordability concerns, especially considering the absence of a credit report to verify financial health and support capacity for this level of debt. This has been reported as a Medium finding.\n\n--\n\nProceeding to Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification. Checking the proposal against the underwriting policies for specific compliance requirements.**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n\nDuring this step, I strictly examined the proposal against the underwriting policies. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Credit Tier Assessment:** The applicant's credit score of **665** places them in **Tier B (Near-Prime)**, as per policy guidelines. This tier allows for standard terms but may require stricter affordability checks. This was confirmed using the policy.\n\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n  - An LTV of **67.97%** (calculated as `(Advance) / (Trade Price)`) was found. This is well within the **100% maximum** allowed for Tier B credits. I flagged this with an affirmative Medium-Severity finding indicating compliance.\n\n- **Vehicle Characteristics:**\n  - The vehicle is a **2019 model (4 years old)**. When adding the proposed term of **48 months**, the vehicle will be **8 years old at the end of the agreement**, which complies with the **12-year maximum**.\n  - The mileage of **48,024 miles** also meets the **maximum allowable 100,000 miles** at the start of the agreement.\n  - The loan term of **48 months** is the **maximum allowable for vehicles over 5 years old**, described in the underwriting rules. This was flagged as a low-severity issue with supporting reasoning.\n  \n- **Debt-To-Income (DTI):**\n  - The applicant's monthly income of **$5,292** and the proposed instalment of **$400/month** result in a DTI ratio of **7.55%**. This is significantly below the 40% DTI maximum for Tier B applicants, marking the proposal as well-compliant with affordability standards. This was flagged as a low-severity point for documentation.\n\n---\n\nProceeding to Step 4: Holistic Synthesis.**Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n\nUpon reviewing all factors collectively, several issues emerge:\n- Though compliant individually, the applicant's credit score, LTV, and DTI ratio suggest borderline financial health.\n- The absence of a credit report represents a crucial missing piece that prevents assessment of deeper financial details, such as past derogatories, or hard search behaviours.\n- The applicant's stated income of $5,292 renders affordability plausible, but additional verification is recommended to manage risk.\n\nThis combination of factors suggests a slightly elevated risk profile and warrants further cautious review. I flagged this as a **Medium severity issue**, recommending closer manual underwriting scrutiny.\n\n---\n\nProceeding to Step 5: Conclusion.\nThroughout my analysis, I adhered to the five-step triage methodology for identifying, documenting, and justifying key findings for this proposal:\n\n### Summary of Key Findings:\n1. **Credit Risk Analysis (Critical)**: The absence of a credit report severely limits the ability to assess creditworthiness.\n2. **Sanity Check (Medium)**: The vehicle’s retail price relative to the reported monthly income raises affordability concerns.\n3. **Policy Compliance**:\n   - Credit tier (Tier B) places the applicant in the \"Near-Prime\" category under standard terms.\n   - LTV (67.97%) is well within the 100% maximum policy threshold for Tier B applicants.\n   - Vehicle meets all age, mileage, and loan-term constraints.\n   - A DTI of 7.55% is far below the Tier B maximum of 40%.\n4. **Holistic View (Medium)**: Individually acceptable metrics together suggest a combination of moderate risks, further compounded by the absence of a credit report.\n\n### Recommendations for Underwriter:\n- **Immediate Action**: The absence of a credit report must be addressed before final approval. If unavailable, this proposal may require declining unless alternative proofs (e.g., employment verification, savings evidence) are provided.\n- **Affordability Confirmation**: Consider requesting additional documentation to confirm stated income or asset savings, given the high-value purchase relative to income.\n- **Manual Review**: Elevated risk factors suggest that a deeper, manual review is warranted to ensure risk is mitigated before approval.\n\n**Conclusion**: All factors have been meticulously assessed and findings reported. This concludes the comprehensive triage of the provided proposal.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
