    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Skipped as no credit report data is available.\n- **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped due to missing credit report, as flagged.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe absence of a credit report makes it impossible to assess the reasonableness of the proposal fully. However, no glaring issues are immediately evident in the available data.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nI will now verify the proposal against company policies by examining credit, asset, loan structure, and affordability.\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\nI will retrieve the \"Credit Tiers\" policy to confirm whether the applicant's stated credit score (665) qualifies for financing.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nBased on my findings:\n1. The absence of a credit report is a critical issue and poses a significant gap in assessing risk.\n2. The applicant's financials and proposal components align well with policy for Tier B credit: the LTV is within limit (67.97%) and the affordability (DTI 8.00%) showcases a strong financial position.\n3. The vehicle age and term comply with policy guidelines.\n\nHowever, without a credit report, vital elements of financial analysis such as credit history, missed payments, and other financial obligations cannot be verified. This introduces a critical blind spot.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAll findings are reported. The application procedure cannot, however, continue as a valid credit report is mandatory as per lending standards.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n1. **Critical Issue: Missing Credit Report** - No credit report was supplied; further action requires rectification of this issue.\n2. **Medium Issue: Credit Score Verification** - Applicant credit score places them in Tier B, necessitating stricter affordability checks (which passed).\n3. **Low Severity Issue: LTV Calculation Valid but High for Tier B** - LTV is within acceptable limits at 67.97%. \n4. **Low Severity Issue: Vehicle Age Eligibility** - Vehicle age aligns with policy requirements.\n5. **Low Severity Issue: DTI Calculation Valid** - Exceptional affordability at 8% DTI, significantly below the allowed 40% for Tier B.\n\n**Final Recommendation: The application cannot proceed until a valid credit report is provided.**\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
