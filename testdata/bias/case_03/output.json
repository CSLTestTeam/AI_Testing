    "reasoning": "### Findings Based on Step 3 (Policy Verification Process)\n\n#### Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)\nCalculation result: **67.97%**\n- **Policy Rule (4.1 LTV):** \n  - Max LTV = **100%** for Tier B credit score. \n- **Analysis:** The applicant's LTV of 67.97% is within policy limits.\n\n#### Credit Score\nApplicant's Credit Score: **665**\n- **Policy Rule (2.1 Credit Tiers):**\n  - Tier: **B (620-699)**\n- **Analysis:** Profile aligns with Tier B, as per policy.\n\n#### Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio\nCalculation result: **8%**\n- **Policy Rule (3.1 DTI Thresholds):**\n  - Max DTI for Tier B = **40%**\n- **Analysis:** The applicant's DTI of 8.0% is well below the 40% threshold for Tier B, indicating strong affordability.\n\n#### Vehicle Criteria\n1. Vehicle **Year**: 2019\n   - **Age** at start = **6 years**\n   - **Policy Rule (4.2 Vehicle Age):** Max at start = **8 years**\n   - **Analysis:** Meets the age criteria.\n   \n2. **Age at End of Term**:\n   - Agreement term: **48 months (4 years)**.\n   - Age at end: **6 + 4 = 10 years**.\n   - **Policy Rule:** Max age = **12 years**.\n   - **Analysis:** Meets the end-of-term age requirements.\n\n3. **Mileage**:\n   - Starting Mileage: **48,024 miles**.\n   - **Policy Rule:** ≤ **100,000 miles** at inception.\n   - **Analysis:** Meets mileage requirements.\n\n4. **Term Length**:\n   - Proposed: **48 months (4 years)**.\n   - **Policy Rule (4.3 Term Limits):**\n     - Max for vehicles >5 years old = **48 months**.\n   - **Analysis:** Compliant with the term restriction.\n\n5. **Minimum Cash Deposit**:\n   - Total deposit includes **cash + part exchange = £15,376**.\n   - Cash Deposit: **£5,226**\n   - **Policy Rule (4.4 Minimum Deposit):** Not applicable for Tier B, as cash deposit requirements exist only in Tier C.\n   - **Analysis:** Compliant.\n\n#### Summary of Policy Conformance\nThe proposal adheres to policy guidelines for LTV, DTI, vehicle age, mileage, term duration, and credit score thresholds. No discrepancies or non-compliances have been identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Steps and Concluding Assessment\nI will synthesize findings to check for potential aggregated risks, considering all steps in the review.\n### Synthesis of Findings and Holistic Analysis\n\n**Key Issues Identified:**\n1. **Credit Report Missing (Critical):**\n   - The absence of a valid credit report makes it impossible to complete credit risk evaluation and fraud checks.\n   - Although all structural and policy-related checks appear compliant, the lack of a credit report represents a significant risk as it is essential to verify the applicant's financial health.\n\n**Other Positive Indicators:**\n- **Policy Adherence:**\n  - The applicant's LTV, DTI, and vehicle/deposit criteria comply with Oakwood's underwriting policies for Tier B.\n\n- **Affordability Confidence:**\n  - Despite missing credit commitments data, the applicant’s low proposed DTI of 8% provides confidence in affordability under standard Tier B thresholds.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the lack of a credit report (Critical severity), I recommend declining the application until complete credit information is provided. While other aspects of the proposal are compliant, the absence of this key data makes the overall assessment inconclusive and unreliable. \n\n### TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
