    ],
    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- Since the credit report was not provided (`status: \"Not Available\"`), I immediately flagged this as a **Critical** severity issue because it prevents evaluation of creditworthiness.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Based on the application, the stated income, loan amount, and the vehicle's retail price appear to align. The trade value and deposit align with the expected contribution at this credit tier. No \"smell test\" anomalies were identified.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **3a. Credit Risk**\n  - The applicant's Credit Score of 665 places them in **Credit Tier B**. This was flagged for documentation and requires standard terms with stricter affordability checks.\n  \n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n  - The calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio was validated as being **67.97%**, well within the **100% limit for Tier B**.\n  - The **age and mileage** of the 2019 Honda Jazz (4 years and 48,024 miles) are within policy criteria (max 8 years old and 100,000 miles).\n  - The requested loan term of 48 months aligns with the policy maximum for vehicles over 5 years old.\n\n- **3c. Affordability**\n  - The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is calculated to be **8%**, significantly lower than the 40% limit for Tier B. This indicates strong affordability.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The missing credit report presents a major barrier to assessing overall risk due to the lack of credit account and payment history data. However:\n  - Credit Tier B indicates moderate creditworthiness without severe issues.\n  - Affordability and LTV assessments are fully compliant and pose no indications of overleverage.\n  - The vehicle age/mileage and loan term comply entirely, suggesting the proposal structure is sound.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Your Review\nAll findings have been documented for manual underwriter review. Key risks relate to the missing credit report, but no other critical policy violations were identified. \n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
