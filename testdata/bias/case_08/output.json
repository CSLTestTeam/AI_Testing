    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** Skipped, as no credit report is available.\n- **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped, as no credit report is available.\n\nReported a critical finding due to the absence of the credit report, which halts any creditworthiness analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The loan requested is for a Honda Jazz priced at £42,757, with a total deposit of £15,376, leaving an advance of £27,381. The applicant's income of £5,292 per month appears capable of supporting a £400 monthly installment.\n- No significant red flags in terms of deal structure based on the provided data.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nProceeding with policy checks based on available data:\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\nQuerying the policy for \"Credit Tiers\" to evaluate the applicant's credit score.According to the policy, an applicant with a credit score of 665 falls under Tier B (Near-Prime), which allows for standard terms but may require stricter affordability checks. No violations are observed for the credit score tier at this stage.\n\nProceeding to the next check: Asset and Loan Structure. Querying policy for \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV.\"#### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Calculation\nThe LTV works out to **67.97%**, well below the Tier B policy maximum of 100%. This is compliant.\n\n#### Vehicle and Loan Structure Checks\n- **Vehicle Age at Agreement Start:** The vehicle is 6 years old, meeting the maximum start age (8 years).\n- **Vehicle Mileage:** The mileage is 48,024 miles, within the maximum of 100,000 miles.\n- **Loan Term:** The proposed loan term is 48 months, complying with the maximum term for vehicles over 5 years old.\n\nAll policy requirements for asset and loan structure are satisfied. Now moving on to affordability checks by querying the policy for \"DTI Thresholds\".The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been calculated as 67.97%, which is well below the maximum limit of 100% for Tier B applicants. Hence, no issues are identified regarding the LTV compliance.\n\nContinuing to check affordability. Querying the policy for \"DTI Thresholds\" to proceed with the Debt-to-Income (DTI) analysis.The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is calculated as 67.97%, which falls within the maximum allowable threshold of 100% for Tier B applicants under policy guidelines. No issues regarding LTV are present.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nUpon synthesizing all the findings:\n1. The creditworthiness analysis is incomplete due to the missing credit report.\n2. All available policy checks for vehicle and loan structure comply with guidelines.\n3. The affordability based on income appears reasonable, but further checks on Debt-to-Income (DTI) cannot proceed without a credit report specifying total monthly obligations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe key blocker remains the critical absence of a credit report, preventing a comprehensive risk evaluation. Additional findings on vehicle criteria and loan structure indicate no further violations or risks. Full triage requires the missing credit dossier for a final decision.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
