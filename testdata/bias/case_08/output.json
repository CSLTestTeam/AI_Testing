    "reasoning": "## Findings and Analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThis step was skipped as the credit report was missing, which is a critical issue.\n\n#### Critical Finding:\n- **Missing Credit Report**  \n  - **Field:** `creditReportJson`  \n  - **Current Value:** Not Available  \n  - **Expected Value:** Credit report required  \n  - **Details:** Unable to perform a credit analysis or verify the integrity of the application data. This is a critical issue as the credit report informs crucial risk factors, including credit score, credit history, and potential fraud markers.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Decline the application until a credit report is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Based on the available data, the applicant is applying for a vehicle that may be considered expensive relative to the stated monthly income. However, affordability calculations alone will provide a definitive answer to this.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n#### 3a. Credit Tiers:\nBased on the policy:\n- The credit score provided in the application is 665.\n- Per policy, this places the applicant in **Credit Tier B (Near-Prime)**, with scores ranging between 620â€“699. \n- The calculated DTI threshold for Tier B is 40%.\n\nNo finding reported as the Credit Score aligns with Tier B.\n\n---\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure:\n1. **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n   - Calculated LTV is **67.97%**.\n   - According to the policy for Tier B, the acceptable maximum LTV is **100%**.\n   - The proposed LTV is within the acceptable limit. \n   - No finding necessary.\n\n2. **Vehicle Age:**\n   - The vehicle is a 2019 model, and the proposal was submitted in October 2025.\n   - Vehicle Age = 2025 - 2019 = **6 years**. It satisfies the max age requirement at agreement start (8 years max). At the end of a 4-year term (48 months), the vehicle's age will be **10 years**, which satisfies the 12-year maximum for the agreement's end.  \n   - No finding necessary.\n\n3. **Mileage:**\n   - Mileage reported for the vehicle is **48,024 miles**, which is below the **maximum mileage of 100,000 miles**.\n   - Policy fully satisfied.  \n   - No finding necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### 3c. Affordability (Debt-to-Income (DTI)):\n- Calculation:\n  - Total Monthly Commitments (excluding proposed instalment): **$0**\n  - Proposed Instalment: **$400**\n  - Net Income: **$5,292**\n  - **DTI = ($0 + $400) / $5,292 * 100 = 8%**\n\n- Per policy, with Credit Tier B, the maximum allowable DTI is **40%**.\n- The applicant's DTI ratio is **significantly below the threshold** for Tier B.  \n  - Result: The affordability criterion is satisfied. No findings necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The proposal satisfies policy requirements for Credit Tier B with regard to LTV, affordability (DTI), vehicle age, and mileage. \n- However, the absence of the credit report remains a critical issue that renders the application non-actionable.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The application demonstrates compliance with key underwriting metrics but cannot proceed due to the absence of a credit report, which is essential for further evaluation. \n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
