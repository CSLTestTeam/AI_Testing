    "reasoning": "### Steps Undertaken and Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification and Credit Analysis\n1. **Credit Report Missing**:\n   - The credit report for the applicant is marked as unavailable. This is critical since it prevents assessment of their financial behavior, including defaults, credit utilization, and fraud checks.\n   - As directed, a high-severity finding was reported regarding the lack of credit report data.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- A high-income applicant seeking financing for a Honda Jazz could raise \"affordability sense\" concerns, but the provided deposit lessens the risk. Given the available data, no significant red flag beyond missing credit data was detected that risked the credibility of the deal.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Score & Tier Check**:\n   - Applicant credit score: 665, placing them in Tier B (Score: 620-699).\n   - A finding was reported to confirm alignment with Tier B requirements.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**:\n   - LTV Calculation: \\( LTV = \\frac{\\text{Advance}}{\\text{Vehicle Trade Price}} = \\frac{27381}{40283} \\times 100 \\approx 67.97\\% \\).\n   - Policy threshold: \\( \\leq 100\\% \\) for Tier B.\n   - The calculated LTV of 67.97% is compliant.\n\n3. **Vehicle Criteria**:\n   - Vehicle age: 2019 model year.\n   - Age at start: \\( \\text{2025} - \\text{2019} = 6 \\text{ years} \\), within the maximum allowable 8 years at start.\n   - Age at end: \\( 6 + \\frac{\\text{48 months}}{\\text{12 months per year}} = 10 \\text{ years} \\), within the maximum 12 years at the end.\n   - Mileage: 48,024 miles, well below the cap of 100,000 miles.\n   - All criteria are policy-compliant.\n\n4. **Affordability Assessment**:\n   - **DTI Calculation**:\n     - \\( DTI = \\frac{\\text{Proposed Monthly Instalment} + \\text{Other Commitments}}{\\text{Net Verified Income}} = \\frac{400}{5292} \\approx 8\\% \\).\n     - Allowed threshold: 40% for Tier B.\n     - The DTI ratio of 8% is far below the threshold, indicating excellent affordability.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The proposal shows low LTV, low DTI, and compliance in vehicle features. Lack of a credit report is the single critical issue. However, other findings strengthen the creditworthiness assessment based on known data.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\n- Reported all findings systematically, categorized by severity, with clear links to policy guidelines. Awaiting further underwriter review.\n\n**Final Findings Summary:**\n1. **Critical Issue**: No credit report provided, blocking comprehensive financial risk analysis.\n2. **Low-Severity Compliance Confirmations**:\n   - Credit score validated within Tier B standards.\n   - LTV compliant (67.97%, below 100%).\n   - DTI far below Tier B threshold (8% vs maximum 40%).\n   - Vehicle age and mileage fully compliant.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
