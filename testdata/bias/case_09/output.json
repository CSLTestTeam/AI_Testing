    "reasoning": "### Review Steps Performed:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **1a. Verifying Data Integrity:** This step was skipped because the credit report is not available.\n- **1b. Analyzing Credit Risk:** This step was skipped due to a missing credit report.\n\n**Finding:** A critical issue has been identified as the credit report is not provided, which is essential for evaluating the applicant's creditworthiness.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nWith the absence of the credit report, it is impossible to perform a meaningful initial analysis of the applicant's credit standing or determine whether the deal passes the \"smell test.\" No irregularities were apparent within the provided data, but this cannot be fully confirmed without credit history information.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **3a. Credit Risk:** This could not be verified due to the absence of the credit report.\n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure:** I will need to proceed with validating the vehicle, LTV, and loan term criteria.\n- **3c. Affordability:** While I can calculate DTI using provided financial figures, a full assessment is impossible due to missing credit history details.\n\nProceeding with LTV and DTI calculations, and verification of relevant policy sections.### Review Summary:\nThe review was conducted in a step-by-step manner as per the outlined process.\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- Credit analysis could not be performed due to the **missing credit report**, constituting a critical issue.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Given the lack of key credit history and risk assessment, the initial check was inconclusive. No glaring \"smell test\" issues are evident, but data gaps leave this area partially unassessable.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n- **Credit Risk (Credit Tiers):** Not verifiable without the credit report.\n- **Loan-to-Value (LTV):** Calculated LTV is **67.97%**, which is well within the maximum limit of **100% for Tier B**.\n- **Debt-to-Income (DTI):** DTI ratio is **8%**, which is well below the maximum limit of **40% for Tier B**.\n- **Vehicle Age and Mileage:** Meets all criteria with a 4-year-old vehicle (age capped at 8 years, 12 years at term's end) and 48,024 miles (cap: 100,000 miles).\n- **Loan Term:** The selected term of **48 months** complies as the maximum permissible for vehicles over 5 years old.\n- **Deposit Requirement:** The proposal includes a **total deposit of £15,376**, equating to 36% of the vehicle's £42,757 cost—well above the 10% minimum in Tier C requirements.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- While the critical credit report omission undermines the review's completeness, the proposal appears robust regarding LTV, affordability, and asset compliance. However, the absence of foundational credit data significantly elevates risk.\n\n### Final Findings:\n1. **Critical:** Missing credit report blocks assessment of the applicant's risk profile and compliance with credit tier policies.\n2. **Medium:** LTV is high at **67.97%**, though within acceptable limits.\n3. **Low:** DTI is exceptionally low (**8%**), vehicle age and mileage comply, and the loan term is permissible.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFinal approval should be withheld until the credit report is provided for a full assessment of compliance with credit-tier policies. While the asset and loan structure appear sound, the inability to perform a credit risk review necessitates allowing the underwriter to evaluate their course of action.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
