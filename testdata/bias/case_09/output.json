    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n1. **Missing Credit Report:**\n   - The credit report is marked as \"Not Available,\" preventing any verification or assessment of the applicant's credit history and financial behavior. This is a critical issue as it provides key data for assessing creditworthiness.\n\n2. **Actions Taken:**\n   - Reported a **Critical** finding for the missing credit report.\n\n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n1. **Sanity Check on Applicant Profile and Vehicle Finances:**\n   - Based on the proposal, the vehicle in question is a Honda Jazz (2019) with 48,024 miles and a retail price of £42,757. The applicant works as a cleaner, with a monthly income of £5,292. The monthly instalment is £400, and a cash deposit of £5,226 is provided. While the vehicle's cost appears high relative to the applicant's job title, their stated income supports the proposed loan.\n   - However, due to the lack of credit report, no additional data could be analyzed (e.g., credit accounts, recent inquiries, or fraud alerts). This undermines the soundness of any conclusions drawn.\n\n2. **Actions Taken:**\n   - No major anomalies or \"smell test\" failures identified, aside from the constraints introduced by the credit report issue.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n**3a. Credit Risk (Using Policy Section 2.1):**\n   - The applicant's credit score is 665, placing them in **Tier B (Near-Prime)**. This requires standard terms but also stricter affordability checks.\n   - Reported a **Medium** severity finding acknowledging Tier B criteria.\n\n**3b. Asset & Loan Structure (Using Policy Section 4.0):**\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n     - Calculated LTV is **67.97%**, well below the Tier B maximum of 100%. No concern here.\n     - Reported a **Low** severity finding confirming compliance.\n   - **Vehicle Age:**\n     - At the start of the agreement, the vehicle is **6 years old** and well within the maximum age of 8 years specified by policy.\n     - Reported a **Low** severity finding confirming compliance.\n   - **Mileage:**\n     - The vehicle has 48,024 miles, which is under the maximum allowed mileage of 100,000 miles.\n     - Reported a **Low** severity finding confirming compliance.\n   - **Loan Term:**\n     - Loan term is **48 months**, meeting the policy's term restriction for vehicles older than 5 years.\n     - Reported a **Low** severity finding confirming compliance.\n\n**3c. Affordability (Using Policy Section 3.0):**\n   - **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**\n     - Calculated DTI is 8%, which is far below the maximum of 40% for Tier B applicants.\n     - Reported a **Low** severity finding confirming compliance.\n   - **Income Verification:**\n     - The stated monthly income aligns with the policy metrics. However, the absence of payslip data introduces uncertainty.\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- Individually, all components of the proposal comply with Tier B policies. However, the absence of critical credit and income verification data presents a significant gap in evaluating the applicant's true risk profile. While the provided data aligns with policy standards, the underwriter cannot ignore this lack of key information.\n\n#### **Step 5: Conclusion of Review**\n- All findings have been reported in the structured analysis above. The primary critical issue remains the absence of the credit report, which severely undermines the ability to make a thorough risk assessment.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
