    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n---\n\n**Step 1**: Data Verification and Credit Analysis  \n- **1a. Data Integrity:**  \n   - The credit report data is missing entirely. This is a critical issue, as it prevents validation of the applicant's financial health and creditworthiness. This issue was flagged as a critical finding.\n   \n   - Applicant's Date of Birth is recorded as February 12, 1915, making the applicant 110 years old. This is highly unreasonable and suggests possible errors or misrepresentation. This issue was flagged as a medium finding.\n\n- **1b. Credit Risk Analysis:**  \n   Skipped due to missing credit report; identified as a critical risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2**: Initial Sanity Check  \n- The loan figures are reasonable for the stated income, with an affordable monthly payment relative to the applicant's stated earnings. However, the missing credit report and unreasonably high applicant age overshadow this case’s legitimacy.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3**: Detailed Policy Verification  \n- **3a. Credit Risk**  \n   - Credit Score: Applicant’s score is 665, placing them in **Tier B (Near-Prime)** according to the policy. No finding has been raised specific to the score tier itself.\n\n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**  \n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**  \n      LTV was calculated to be **67.97%** (acceptable as per Tier B policy limit of 100%).  \n      → No issue was identified.  \n\n   - **Vehicle Criteria:**  \n      - Vehicle Age: 2019 model, current age = 6 years. At the end of the 4-year term, the vehicle will be 10 years old. Both parameters fall within allowable limits (Max age at start = 8 years; Max at end = 12 years).  \n      - Mileage: 48,024 miles is comfortably below the 100,000-mile limit.  \n      → No issues identified.  \n\n   - **Term Length:**  \n      The term is 48 months, which aligns with the policy of up to 60 months. Additionally, since the vehicle is over 5 years old, the 48-month term is within the 4-year restriction.  \n      → No issues were found.  \n\n- **3c. Affordability**  \n   - The Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio was calculated to be **8%**, significantly lower than the maximum allowable 40% for Tier B applicants. This is a favorable affordability indicator and was flagged as a low-severity positive finding.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4**: Holistic Synthesis  \n- Combining multiple issues, the missing credit report and the unreasonable age of the applicant stand out as major red flags in this case. This raises questions about the validity of the details provided and necessitates further scrutiny, as the likelihood of fraud or data errors is exceedingly high.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5**: Conclusion  \nHaving methodically analyzed the proposal, I identified the following issues of note:  \n- **Critical:** The absence of credit report data prevents full risk assessment.  \n- **Medium:** Likely erroneous or fraudulent date of birth, requiring verification of identity.  \n- **Low:** Positive indication of affordability due to a very low Debt-to-Income ratio.  \n\nThese findings create a picture of high risk due to missing mandatory credit information and potential fraud. While the financial figures and vehicle criteria themselves align with policy guidelines, the reliability of applicant information requires urgent verification.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
