    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Review and Findings:\n\n**Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **1a. Verify Data Integrity:** This was not possible since no credit report was provided in `creditReportJson`.\n  - Critical finding reported: Missing Credit Report.\n- **1b. Analyze Credit Risk:** Skipped due to the absence of a credit report.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- The applicant appears to be realistically applying for a vehicle of significant value. The loan advance, relative to stated income and overall affordability, is reasonable. No immediate red flags were identified during this step.\n\n**Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **3a. Credit Risk:** \n  - The applicant's credit score (665) places them in \"Tier B\" per policy, permitting standard terms, though stricter affordability checks may be required. A finding was logged as \"Medium\" for classification into Tier B.\n- **3b. Asset & Loan Structure Validation:**\n  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio:** The LTV ratio was calculated to be 67.97%, which is well within the policy maximum of 100% for Tier B applicants. Finding logged as \"Low\".\n  - **Vehicle Age Criteria:** The vehicle's age meets policy requirements, both at the beginning (6 years) and the end (10 years) of the agreement term. Finding logged as \"Low.\"\n- **3c. Affordability (Debt-to-Income Ratio):** \n  - The DTI was calculated to be 8%, significantly below the 40% maximum for Tier B applicants. This is a positive indicator of affordability. Finding logged as \"Low.\"\n\n**Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- Based on the combined analysis:\n  - Applicant's credit score, LTV ratio, DTI ratio, and vehicle specifications are within acceptable limits.\n  - The missing credit report is a substantial impediment to thorough risk analysis and a critical finding. However, the affordability and structural attributes of the proposal are largely favorable.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n- Findings from all steps have been reported. Despite favorable financial metrics, the absence of the credit report represents a significant risk and requires resolution before proceeding.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
