    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- Skipped Step 1 as there was no credit report provided for this proposal. Reported as a *Critical* issue under the field `CreditReport`.\n\n### Step 2: Core Figures \"Sanity Check\"\n- Key figures such as loan amount and applicant income seem reasonable. There are no major red flags in the preliminary review.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk Assessment**\n   - Applicant's credit score is 665, which falls under Tier B (\"Near-Prime\") requiring standard terms with potentially stricter affordability assessments. This has been *flagged as Medium severity* as it will influence downstream affordability checks.\n\n2. **Asset & Loan Policy Compliance**\n   - **LTV Calculation**: The calculated LTV ratio is **67.97%**. This is well within the permissible 100% threshold for Tier B. Findings report confirms compliance.\n   - **Vehicle Age Policy**: The 2019 Honda Jazz will be 12 years old by the end of the 48-month term, meeting the maximum age threshold of 12 years allowed under the policy. This was also *flagged and reported* for review.\n   - **Term Length**: The 48-month term is compliant with the maximum term length allowed for vehicles less than 5 years old. No issues here.\n\n3. **Affordability**\n   - **DTI Ratio**: The calculated DTI is **8%**, falling well below the maximum allowable DTI of **40%** for Tier B applicants. The findings reported indicate compliance.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nUpon review of all identified findings during individual checks: \n- While the applicant's credit report is missing (critical issue), the provided data (Applicant Credit Score, DTI, LTV, and Vehicle Age) indicate compliance with relevant policies.\n- No issues with the combination of assessed parameters that require an aggregated severity level adjustment.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nReviewed the entire process step by step. All identified findings have been reported, with adherence to the underwriting policy manual wherever applicable.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
