    "reasoning": "## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThis step was skipped because no credit report was provided. A critical severity finding was raised due to the absence of the credit report, which is essential for evaluating the applicant's financial history.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe provided data was evaluated for coherence:\n- The applicant's credit score of 665 places them in Tier B, which is eligible under standard terms based on policy guidelines.\n- The stated monthly income is $5292, and the monthly instalments ($400) are less than 10% of the income, which appears reasonable.\n- No mismatch between the nature of the vehicle (a Honda Jazz), its cost, and the loan request was flagged during this stage.\n  \nNo major \"smell-test\" issues were identified.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk**:\n   - Credit score of 665 places the applicant in **Tier B** (requirement: 620 - 699).\n   - A Medium severity finding was reported since the applicant does not qualify for Tier A (minimum 700).\n\n2. **Asset & Loan Structure**:\n   - **LTV Ratio**: Calculated at 67.97%, which is within the Tier B maximum allowable of 100%. A Medium severity finding was raised to confirm that the application complies with policy for Tier B.\n   - **Vehicle Age & Mileage**:\n     - Initial age = 4 years (compliant with maximum starting age of 8 years).\n     - Final age = 9 years, within the limit of 12 years. \n     - Mileage = 48024 miles, which is within the maximum allowed of 100,000 miles. These factors were deemed compliant, and a Medium finding was raised for confirmation.\n   - **Loan Term**: Loan term is 48 months, which is compliant with the policy's maximum of 60 months, and also aligns with the maximum allowed term for vehicles over 5 years old at the start of the agreement. No finding was reported as this fully meets criteria.\n   - **Minimum Deposit**: Not applicable as the applicant qualifies for Tier B and has already made a sufficient deposit (cash + part exchange total of $15,376, which is significant).\n\n3. **Affordability (DTI)**:\n   - **DTI Ratio** was calculated at 8%, which is well below the Tier B maximum of 40%. A Low severity finding was reported to confirm compliance.\n\n### Additional Policy Check\n- The applicant's date of birth indicates an age below 18 years as of the application date, which raises significant regulatory and risk concerns because the applicant is not legally eligible to enter into a financing agreement. A Medium severity finding was raised, suggesting immediate decline.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining the findings:\n- The critical absence of a credit report undermines the integrity of the applicant's creditworthy evaluation.\n- Although the application complies with some key metrics (e.g., DTI, LTV, and vehicle age), the applicant's underage status constitutes a legal barrier.\n- No fraud-warning section or other extraordinary behavior patterns were noted.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nI have methodically reviewed the entire proposal and noted all material issues. Despite the proposal meeting several policy requirements, the absence of a critical credit report and the applicant being underage are overriding disqualifiers.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
