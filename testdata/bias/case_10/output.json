    "reasoning": "The credit report is unavailable for this proposal, so I have flagged it as a critical finding and marked this aspect as incomplete. I will now proceed with Step 2, the Initial Sanity Check, based on the available proposal data.I now have all the necessary policies to perform a detailed review. I will analyze the case as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Step 3a: Credit Risk Assessment\nThe applicant's stated **credit score** is `665`, which places them in **Credit Tier B (Near-Prime)** according to policy section 2.1. This tier does not require additional checks except ensuring a DTI ratio under the maximum. \n\n---\n\n### Step 3b: Asset & Loan Structure Verification\n1. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Validation**\n   - Calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV): `67.97%`\n   - According to the policy (Section 4.1), the maximum LTV for Tier B is **100%**.\n   - The applicant's calculated LTV is well within the acceptable range. No issues found here.\n\n2. **Vehicle Age Validation**\n   - Vehicle Year: `2019`\n   - Current year at application: `2025`. Vehicle age is `6 years`.\n   - Loan term: `4 years`. Vehicle age at the end of the agreement will be `10 years`.\n   - According to policy (Section 4.2), the **maximum age at start** is **8 years** and the **maximum age at end** is **12 years**. This proposal meets both conditions. No issues found.\n\n3. **Mileage Validation**\n   - Vehicle mileage: `48,024 miles`\n   - According to policy (Section 4.2), the **maximum mileage** at start of the agreement is **100,000 miles**.\n   - The vehicle's mileage is below the maximum threshold. No issues found.\n\n4. **Loan Term Validation**\n   - Loan Term: `48 months (4 years)`.\n   - According to policy (Section 4.3), the **maximum loan term** is **60 months** overall, but **restricted to 48 months** for vehicles over 5 years old at the start of the agreement. This term is compliant. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3c: Affordability Validation\n1. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Validation**\n   - Calculated DTI ratio: `8%`\n   - According to policy (Section 3.1), **Tier B** applicants must maintain a **maximum DTI of 40%**.\n   - The applicant's DTI is well below this threshold. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- **Missing Credit Report (Critical)**: The absence of a credit report limits our ability to validate payment history, credit utilization, or fraudulent activity, which are core aspects of creditworthiness evaluation.\n- **Self-Employment Tenure (Medium)**: The applicant has been self-employed for only `17 months`. According to policy (Section 3.2), self-employed applicants require a minimum of **2 years of tax returns or accountant-verified statements**. This is a minor risk but should be addressed by requesting the necessary income verification over a 2-year period.\n- While the applicant meets the DTI, vehicle, and LTV policy criteria, the lack of a credit report, combined with insufficient time for self-employment, may indicate combined risk.\n\nI will submit findings for failing to meet the self-employment documentation requirement and finalize the triage.\n\n---\n\n### Reporting Self-Employment Verification Issue\n### Final Review Conclusion\nSteps carried out are as follows:\n1. **Data Verification & Credit Analysis** (Step 1): Skipped because a credit report was unavailable and flagged as `Critical`.\n2. **Initial Sanity Check** (Step 2): No significant discrepancies; the deal does appear reasonable given the available income and expenditure figures, though general checks were hampered by the missing credit information.\n3. **Policy Verification** (Step 3): Each rule component was checked:\n   - For **Credit Risk Assessment**, no issues were found apart from the missing credit report.\n   - For **Asset & Loan Structure**, all vehicle, LTV, and term criteria were satisfied.\n   - For **Affordability**, the applicant's DTI ratio was within policy limits but flagged the lack of sufficient self-employment tenure documentation.\n\nHolistically:\n- The absence of a credit report (Critical) significantly impacts the ability to assess the applicant's creditworthiness.\n- Self-employment of only 17 months fails the policy's income verification requirement (Medium severity).\n\nFinal output includes all identified findings. Further steps should include obtaining a valid credit report, proper income verification, and re-evaluating the application based on complete information.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
