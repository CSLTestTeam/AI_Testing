    "reasoning": "### Triaged Findings and Analysis\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n1. **Credit Report Missing (Critical Issue)**:\n   - **Finding**: No credit report data was provided for this proposal.\n   - **Impact**: Essential creditworthiness and fraud analysis cannot be performed.\n   - This was reported as a **Critical Severity** finding.\n\n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- The proposal's figures, such as Stated Monthly Income ($5,292) against the requested advance ($27,381) and DTI (8%, well below accepted thresholds), appear reasonable.\n- The financing terms and vehicle value align with the customer's expected affordability and credit tier.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n1. **Credit Tier**:\n   - **Credit Score**: Verified as 665, which qualifies for **Tier B (Near-Prime)** per policy.\n   - **Finding**: Confirmed compliance with the Tier B credit band.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**:\n   - **Calculation**: Using the Advance ($27,381) and Trade Price ($40,283), LTV = **67.97%**.\n   - **Finding**: This is within the **100% maximum LTV for Tier B**, per policy. No violation noted.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**:\n   - **Calculation**: Monthly instalment ($400) added to other commitments ($0), divided by stated monthly income ($5,292) = **8% DTI**.\n   - **Finding**: This is below the **40% maximum DTI for Tier B**, per policy. No violation noted.\n\n4. **Self-Employment Income Verification**:\n   - **Issue**: Applicant has only **17 months** of self-employment but is required to show **24 months minimum** of income verification for self-employed applicants.\n   - **Finding**: Reported as a medium-severity issue requiring additional documentation (tax returns or accountant-verified statements) to verify income stability.\n\n5. **Vehicle Age & Criteria**:\n   - **Start of Agreement**: Vehicle is **6 years old**, which is within the **8-year maximum at the start of the agreement**.\n   - **End of Agreement**: Vehicle will reach **12 years** at the end of the term, meeting the **maximum allowable age of 12 years**.\n   - **Mileage**: Currently at **48,024 miles**, well below the **100,000-mile threshold**.\n   - **Findings**: Age and mileage comply with policy, but the final age matches the upper limit; flagged for monitoring.\n\n6. **Loan Term**:\n   - Agreement length is **48 months**, which satisfies the policy allowing a maximum of **60 months** for vehicles aged up to 5 years, or 48 months for older vehicles.\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- The individual findings present a moderate risk profile due to the following:\n    - Missing credit report is a critical issue limiting risk assessment.\n    - Compliance with credit and loan criteria reduces immediate concerns, except for:\n        - The self-employment history does not satisfy policy requirements. Proof of income consistency is crucial.\n        - The vehicle age at term end reaches its maximum; any delays or misrepresentation in age would necessitate re-evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll identified findings have been reported with relevant policy references and justified recommendations to the underwriter for further evaluation. While the proposal generally aligns with policy, significant concerns about income verification (self-employment duration) and critical missing credit report data necessitate action before proceeding.\n\n#### Final Statement:  \n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
