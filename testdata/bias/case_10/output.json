    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Data Verification**: This step was skipped due to the absence of a credit report.\n- **Credit Analysis**: Similarly skipped, as no financial health factors or financial behaviors could be reviewed without the credit report.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- A \"critical\" finding was reported in the first step due to the missing credit report, which significantly affects my ability to gauge the overall creditworthiness of the applicant. However, a general review of the proposal noted no glaring inconsistencies aside from this.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nDespite the absence of a credit report, I will proceed to verify other policy-related parameters.\n\n#### Verification 3a: Credit Risk\nA formal lookup for \"Credit Tiers\" policy will be conducted to confirm any thresholds applicable to the applicant's reported credit score (665).\n\n#### Verification 3b: Asset & Loan Structure\nNext, I will:\n1. Verify the vehicle's eligibility (age and mileage).\n2. Calculate the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and check it against the policy for conformity.\n3. Validate loan term against the policy.\n\n#### Verification 3c: Affordability\nI will verify the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio using the provided financial data and compare it against policy thresholds.\n\nLet me systematically query the relevant policies and perform calculations. Stand by.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nAfter methodically analyzing each element of the proposal and its compliance with underwriting policy, I found the following points worth synthesizing:\n- The applicant's credit tier is Tier B, which allows for standard processing but involves stricter affordability checks.\n- Key financial metrics like LTV (67.97%) and DTI (8%) are well within the comfortable thresholds for a Tier B applicant.\n- The vehicle's age (4 years) and mileage (48,024 miles) easily comply with policy limits.\n\nNo synthesized risks arise from low-level or borderline findings. This proposal shows strong alignment with underwriting guidelines (apart from the critical missing credit report).\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Your Review\nI have completed a comprehensive assessment, systematically evaluating the proposal against policy guidelines and performing all reasonably possible checks in the absence of a credit report. The findings detailed above were identified and reported to comprehensively inform underwriting.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
