        ## 2.0 Credit Risk Assessment

        Customer creditworthiness is assessed using a tiered system based on their credit score, obtained from our designated Credit Reference Agency (CRA).

        ### 2.1 Credit Tiers

        | Tier | Credit Score Band | Notes |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | **A (Prime)** | 700+ | Eligible for best rates and most flexible terms. |
        | **B (Near-Prime)** | 620 - 699 | Standard terms apply. May require stricter affordability checks. |
        | **C (Sub-Prime)** | 550 - 619 | Requires stricter lending criteria, including potential deposit minimums. |
        | **D (Decline)** | Below 550 | Automatic decline unless exceptional, documented circumstances exist. |

        ## 3.0 Affordability Assessment

        Affordability is primarily assessed using the **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** ratio.

        `DTI = (Total Monthly Credit Commitments + Proposed Monthly Instalment) / Verified Net Monthly Income`

        ### 3.1 DTI Thresholds

        The maximum allowable DTI ratio is determined by the applicant's Credit Tier:

        Tier A:** Maximum DTI is 45%
        Tier B:** Maximum DTI is 40%.
        Tier C:** Maximum DTI is 35%.

        ### 3.2 Income Verification

        *   **Standard Employment (PAYE):** Income must be verified via the most recent payslip. If the stated income on the application differs from the payslip by more than **5%**, the lower value (payslip) must be used for all calculations.
        *   **Self-Employed:** A minimum of **2 years** of tax returns or accountant-verified statements are required. The average net income over the two years should be used.

        ## 4.0 Asset & Loan Structure Rules

        These rules govern the structure of the finance agreement itself.

        ### 4.1 Loan-to-Value (LTV)

        LTV is calculated as `(Total Advance) / (Vehicle Trade Price)`.
        
      The maximum permitted LTV is based on the Credit Tier:

        - Tier A (Prime): 110% (Allows financing of fees or small negative equity)
        - Tier B (Near-Prime): 100%
        - Tier C (Sub-Prime): 95%

        ### 4.2 Vehicle Criteria

        *   **Maximum Age at Start of Agreement:** **8 years**.
        *   **Maximum Age at End of Agreement:** **12 years**. The underwriter must calculate this (`Vehicle Age + Term Years`).
        *   **Maximum Mileage at Start of Agreement:** **100,000 miles**.
        *   Vehicles previously recorded as Category S or N (Structural or Non-Structural write-offs) are not eligible for finance.

        ### 4.3 Term Lengths

        *   The maximum term for any agreement is **60 months (5 years)**.
        *   For vehicles over **5 years old** at the start of the agreement, the maximum term is restricted to **48 months (4 years)**.

        ### 4.4 Minimum Deposit

        *   For applicants in **Credit Tier C**, a minimum cash deposit of **10%** of the vehicle's Goods Cost is mandatory. This cannot be financed.

        ## 5.0 Fraud & Identity Verification

        *   All applicants must pass standard KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks.
        *   **Income Discrepancy:** As per section 3.2, any significant variance requires justification.
        *   **Applicant History Discrepancy:** Multiple applications (more than 2 in 90 days) from the same applicant with material differences in core information (e.g., employer, address history, income) must be flagged for manual fraud review. The proposal should be placed on hold until the review is complete.

        *   The GMFV cannot be manually inflated.

        ### 6.2 Hire Purchase (HP)
