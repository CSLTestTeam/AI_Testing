    ],
    "reasoning": "I systematically reviewed the proposal as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Credit Report Missing (Critical Finding)**: No credit report was supplied for this proposal. As credit reports provide critical insights to validate the proposal's accuracy and assess financial health, this is a severe shortfall. Reported this as **Critical.**\n\nSince the credit report does not exist, all Step 1 activities (data verification, credit risk analysis) were skipped.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- **Sanity Check Observation**: Given the applicant's very high stated income and \"Prime\" credit score, the proposed loan and vehicle choice align reasonably. There are no major discrepancies in this regard to report.\n\nNo findings were raised in this step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n**3a. Credit Risk Analysis:**\n- **Credit Score Tier (Low Severity Finding)**: Applicant's credit score of 731 qualifies them for Tier A (Prime), as it meets the \"700+\" threshold in policy section 2.1.\n\n**3b. Asset & Loan Structure Verification:**\n- **Loan-to-Value Ratio Misalignment (Medium Severity Finding)**: Using the formula specified in policy 4.1, the LTV ratio was calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  LTV = \\frac{\\text{Advance: } 67381}{\\text{Trade Price: } 40283} = 167.27\\%\n  \\]\n  However, the maximum LTV allowed for Tier A applicants is 110%. The calculated value significantly exceeds this threshold, mandating a review for potential mitigation or rejection.\n \n- **Vehicle Age Compliance**: The 2019 Honda Jazz will be 6 years old at the conclusion of the 36-month term. This satisfies the policy's \"Maximum Vehicle Age at Agreement End\" cap of 12 years and therefore needs no reporting.\n- **Vehicle Mileage Compliance**: The vehicle's declared mileage is 48,024 miles at the outset, which falls well within the cap of 100,000 miles at the initiation of the agreement. No findings were made here.\n\n**3c. Affordability Analysis:**\n- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio (Low Severity Finding)**:\n  \n  The DTI ratio was calculated using the provided income, monthly commitments as zero, and installment data:\n  \\[\n  DTI = \\frac{\\text{Proposed Monthly Instalment: } 400}{\\text{Stated Monthly Income: } 20292} = 2\\%\n  \\]\n  This is substantially below the 45% cap for Tier A borrowers (policy section 3.1), confirming robust affordability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nAlthough the applicant demonstrates excellent creditworthiness and affordability capacity, the high Loan-to-Value Ratio (167.27%) constitutes a severe policy breach and serves as the single most significant risk factor in this case. Combined with the missing credit report, it raises further concerns about whether this deal aligns with established policy and risk tolerance.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
