    "reasoning": "### Steps Taken in Review\n\n#### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n- **1a: Verify Data Integrity**: This step was skipped since no credit report was available for comparison.\n- **1b: Analyze Credit Risks**: This step was also skipped due to the absence of a credit report.\n\nFinding:\n1. **Critical Issue**: No credit report was provided, which constitutes a major compliance issue, as it prevents assessment of the applicant's risk profile.\n\n#### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n- Observed that the applicant's date of birth (2011-02-12) places them at only 14 years old, which is below the legal threshold for entering into a financial agreement in the jurisdiction.\n\nFinding:\n2. **Critical Issue**: The applicant is under 18 years of age, in violation of legal and policy eligibility standards.\n\n#### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n- **3a: Credit Risk**:\n  - Verified credit tiers policy, and only Tier C would apply based on the applicant's stated credit score of 665. However, due to a missing credit report, no formal assessment could be conducted.\n\n- **3b: Asset & Loan Structure**:\n  - Verified Loan-to-Value (LTV) for the advance amount of £27,381 and trade price of £40,283. The calculated LTV was 67.97%, which is well within the Tier C limit of 95%.\n  - Need verification of the Tier of the applicant, as this directly affects the LTV limit.\n\nFinding:\n3. **High Issue**: The calculated LTV of 67.97% raises no direct concerns against the policy limits, but the absence of a credit report prevents full validation of the LTV against a verified Tier.\n\n- **3c: Affordability**:\n  - Skipped due to insufficient verified financial and credit background to calculate Debt-to-Income (DTI).\n\n#### **Step 4: Holistic Synthesis**\n- The absence of a credit report is a critical barrier to validating the applicant's risk tier and ensuring the proposal aligns holistically with underwriting policies.\n- Combining the applicant's minor status (age 14) with the absence of foundational credit data makes this proposal unfeasible for any further consideration in its current state.\n\n### Conclusion\nMultiple critical findings prevent the underwriter from making an informed decision:\n1. No credit report was provided, rendering proper credit and financial background analysis impossible.\n2. The applicant is underage (14 years old), disqualifying them legally from entering into a financial agreement.\n\nGiven these critical findings, this application cannot proceed further without immediate corrective actions.\n\n**Final Statement**\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
