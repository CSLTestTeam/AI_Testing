    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Review\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Credit Report Check**:\n   - No credit report was provided for this application, which is a critical issue. A credit report is essential for accurate underwriting, and its absence violates fundamental principles.\n\n   **Action Taken**: Reported as a critical finding.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The stated monthly income of £20,292 seems abnormally high for a \"Technical Lead\" with only seven months of employment experience. This raises concerns about the authenticity and credibility of the income declaration. \n   \n   **Action Taken**: No specific report yet, awaiting further findings.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\na. **Credit Risk**:\n   - Credit score of 560 places the applicant in \"Tier C\" (550–619).\n   - Tier C applicants require stricter lending criteria due to their increased risk.\n\n   **Action Taken**: Reported as a medium-severity finding due to stricter policy requirements for Tier C.\n\nb. **Asset & Loan Structure**:\n   - **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: Calculated at 67.97%, which is below the Tier C maximum of 95%. However, since the credit profile is already risky, this borderline acceptable LTV may require further prudence.\n   - **Vehicle Age at End of Loan Term**: The vehicle is from 2022 and would be four years old at the end of the loan. This is within the policy maximum of 12 years.\n   - **Vehicle Mileage**: At 148,024 miles, the vehicle significantly exceeds the policy's maximum of 100,000 miles at the start of the agreement, making the vehicle ineligible for financing.\n   - **Term Length**: The provided term of 36 months is acceptable as the vehicle is less than five years old.\n\n   **Actions Taken**:\n   - Reported high mileage as a significant finding (high severity).\n   - LTV ratio was noted but considered acceptable for Tier C (low severity).\n\nc. **Affordability**:\n   - **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**: Calculated at 2%, which is well below the maximum of 35% for Tier C applicants. Affordability appears solid, assuming reported income is accurate.\n   - **Stated Income Validation**: Normally, this would require verification through a recent payslip per policy, especially given the exceptionally high figure for the applicant's employment profile.\n\n   **Action Taken**:\n   - Reported acceptable DTI as a low-severity finding.\n   - Investigated policy for potential income misstatement. Further steps may require documentation (e.g., payslips).\n\n### Final Findings Summary\n\n1. **Credit Report**: Missing credit report constitutes a critical issue that typically precludes processing the application.\n2. **Credit Score**: Medium-risk Tier C needs additional scrutiny under policy terms.\n3. **Vehicle Mileage**: Vehicle ineligibility due to excessively high mileage, a significant policy violation.\n4. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: LTV ratio within acceptable parameters for Tier C but should be monitored.\n5. **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Positive affordability confirmed, subject to income validation. No immediate concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation\nThis proposal has multiple significant issues:\n1. The absence of a credit report (Critical).\n2. Vehicle ineligibility due to mileage exceeding policy maximum (High).\n\nGiven these findings, the proposal cannot proceed in its current form. Other minor risks (Tier C credit score, LTV considerations) underscore an overall higher risk profile but are less material in light of the primary findings.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
