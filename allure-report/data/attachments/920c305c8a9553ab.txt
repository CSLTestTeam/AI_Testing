Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies many relevant issues such as the borderline credit score, the vehicle being 13 years old at term end, and compliance with the LTV and DTI policies. However, a key omission is failing to flag that the vehicle is also 8 years old at the start of the agreement, which is the maximum allowed per policy Section 4.2; this should be explicitly called out as highlighted in the expected output. No hallucinations or invented details are present, and analysis is otherwise thorough and methodical.
