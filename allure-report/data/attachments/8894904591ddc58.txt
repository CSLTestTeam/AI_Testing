Reasoning: The response analyzes most proposal details, correctly validating vehicle age, mileage, loan term, and LTV against policy and reporting findings as per process. However, it incorrectly flags the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio as compliant (2.0% vs allowed ≤35%) when, per policy, the DTI calculation should include all monthly credit commitments. The provided credit report shows substantial existing monthly payments (£2138), which should result in a DTI of about 12.5%, not 2.0%. This is material because the output fails to highlight that the actual DTI calculation and comparison should use the sum of all monthly obligations (including the £400 proposed instalment), and should have flagged whether this combined DTI exceeds (or does not exceed) the policy threshold. This oversight means the expected finding regarding DTI policy compliance was not properly addressed.
