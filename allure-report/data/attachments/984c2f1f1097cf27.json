    "reasoning": "# Concluding Steps:\nI followed the specified five-step process comprehensively. Below is a summary of my workflow and findings:\n\n1. **Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n    - Skipped entirely due to the **critical absence of a credit report**, explicitly noted as a critical finding.\n    - Reported the critical finding for \"Missing Credit Report.\"\n\n2. **Initial Sanity Check**\n    - The deal seems feasible in terms of LTV, affordability, and available information.\n    - No major red flags, beyond the missing credit report, that fail a \"gut check.\"\n\n3. **Detailed Policy Verification**\n    - **Credit Tier and Risk:**\n        - Applicant's credit score of 665 places them in **Tier B**. \n        - Reported finding: \"Credit Scoring Criteria Mismatch.\"\n    - **Loan-to-Value Assessment:**\n        - Calculated LTV: 67.97% against the policy max of 100% for Tier B.\n        - Reported LTV compliance with Tier B guidelines.\n    - **Debt-to-Income Affordability Analysis:**\n        - Calculated DTI: 8%, far below the 40% max threshold for Tier B.\n        - Reported low DTI as a positive finding for affordability.\n    - **Vehicle Criteria:**\n        - Vehicle is within policy-compliant parameters. The maximum contract term is 48 months which aligns with the vehicle age.\n        - No issues reported.\n\n4. **Holistic Synthesis**\n    - A critical finding regarding the absence of the credit report is a decisive blocker. Although individually assessed factors (LTV and DTI) are within acceptable ranges, the lack of the credit report makes full assessment of the applicant's creditworthiness impossible. This absence negates the reliability of any potential approval.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe absence of the credit report constitutes a critical issue, rendering the proposal unfit for approval without this omission being addressed. Although other financial metrics (LTV and DTI) meet policy conditions for Tier B applications, the decision-making process cannot be finalized due to a significant information gap.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
