Reasoning: The actual output incorrectly flags the credit report as missing and bases multiple steps and findings around its absence, which should be ignored given the instructions. For the remaining analysis, the output faithfully reports the Loan-to-Value ratio as 67.97%, matching input data, and rightly states this is compliant with Tier B policy. The initial sanity check reflects the provided proposal values and applicant profile accurately, mentioning that the figures make sense and appear plausible. However, some reasoning is cut off mid-sentence and other required policy checks (such as DTI calculation, vehicle age/mileage, applicant data integrity, credit account negatives, and search history review) are either truncated or completely omitted. There are no hallucinations beyond the credit report mistake, but the incomplete and partial reasoning, missing findings, and lack of synthesis affect completeness and alignment.
