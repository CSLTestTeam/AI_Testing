Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response accurately identifies and describes most relevant findings based on the input, including the applicant's credit score, LTV, and DTI, using correct values from the proposal. It makes no hallucinations except for the expected and non-penalized missing credit report. However, it omits mentioning the high number of recent credit searches from the credit report's search history, which the evaluation explicitly requires. This omission impacts completeness but overall, the output is faithful and precise otherwise.
