    "reasoning": "### Step-by-Step Review and Findings Summary\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification and Credit Analysis\n- **Step 1a: Verify Data Integrity**\n  - **Critical Finding: Absence of Credit Report**\n    - No credit report data was provided for this proposal. This is a critical issue as it prevents a comprehensive assessment of the applicant's financial and credit history. Immediate follow-up is necessary to request the missing report.\n\n- **Step 1b: Analyze Credit Risk**\n  - Skipped due to the absence of a credit report.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The provided application does not immediately raise \"smell test\" concerns, but without the credit report, any informal assessment remains incomplete. The credit score suggests this is a Tier B applicant under current underwriting policy.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification:\n- **3a: Credit Risk**\n  - The applicant's credit score is 665, which places them in Tier B as per policy (range: 620-699). \n    - **Medium Finding:** Reported to ensure Tier B policies are applied.\n\n- **3b: Asset & Loan Structure**\n  - **Vehicle Age and Mileage**:\n    - Vehicle is a 2019 model with 48,024 miles. The mileage and age meet the policy's requirements:\n      - Maximum start-of-term age: 8 years.\n      - Maximum end-of-term age: 12 years.\n      - Maximum start-of-term mileage: 100,000 miles.\n    - No concerns identified here.\n\n    - **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n      - Calculated LTV is 67.97%, falling well below the Tier B maximum permissible LTV of 100%.\n      - **Low Finding:** Calculated LTV reported as meeting policy criteria for transparency.\n\n  - **Loan Term:**\n    - Proposal suggests a 4-year term. Per policy, this term complies with the criteria (maximum loan term for the vehicle's age is 48 months).\n\n- **3c: Affordability**\n  - **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**\n    - Calculated DTI is 8%, significantly below the maximum permissible Tier B threshold of 40%.\n    - **Low Finding:** DTI reported as compliant with policy to confirm affordability.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- The combination of findings presents a generally acceptable risk profile:\n  - Applicant is Tier B (medium risk).\n  - LTV and DTI ratios are well within acceptable limits.\n  - Absence of credit report remains a critical limitation to completing risk evaluation, especially to check for outstanding debts or delinquent accounts.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Reporting findings as thoroughly as possible given the absence of a credit report. Immediate follow-up is required to obtain this crucial data before final underwriting decisions can proceed.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
