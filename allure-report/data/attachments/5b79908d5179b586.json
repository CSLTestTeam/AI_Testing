    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification and Credit Analysis\n* No credit report was provided (`creditReportJson` indicates status: \"Not Available\"). A critical issue was flagged and reported since credit analysis is crucial for underwriting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe proposal states a `CreditScore` of 550 and a high stated monthly income of £20,292. These factors appear mismatched for the following reasons:\n1. A credit score of 550 typically indicates poor creditworthiness.\n2. A high stated income needs further corroboration to ensure it's plausible. \n\nHowever, no specific findings from Step 2 can be reported yet without validating affordability and asset values against policy in following steps.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nI will proceed to analyze the following three areas based on policy.\n\n---\n\n#### Actions:\n1. Fetch policy for \"Credit Tiers\" to verify `CreditScore` threshold for Tier eligibility.\n2. Fetch policy for \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\", calculate LTV, and evaluate vehicle's compliance with age/mileage restrictions.\n3. Fetch policy for \"DTI Thresholds\" and calculate the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.### Step 3 Analysis Results:\n\n#### **Credit Risk**\n- **Proposal Analysis:**\n  - Applicant's credit score: **550**\n  - Policy Requirement for Tier C: 550-619; requires stricter lending criteria.\n  - Policy Directive for scores below **550**: **Automatic decline** unless exceptional, documented circumstances exist.\n- Action Taken: Reported **critical finding** regarding credit score, recommending potential decline.\n\n---\n\n#### **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**\n- **LTV Calculated:** 67.97%\n  - Formula: `(Advance) / (Vehicle Trade Price)` = £27,381 / £40,283 * 100.\n- **Policy Requirement for Tier C:** 95% or less.\n- Action Taken: Reported finding as this LTV is **acceptable** under policy limitations.\n\n---\n\n#### **Asset Vetting (Vehicle Criteria)**\n- Vehicle Model Year: **2015 (10 years old).** \n- **Policy Limits:** \n  - Maximum age at agreement commencement: **8 years**.\n- **Finding:** The vehicle **violates policy on maximum age**; reported **low severity finding**. \n\nAdditionally:\n- **Mileage:** 48,024 (policy limit: 100,000) - **No issues.**\n  \n---\n\n#### **DTI Assessment**\n- **Formula:** `(Total Monthly Commitments + Proposed Installment) / Verified Income`\n    > 400 Proposed ≈ Rest"
