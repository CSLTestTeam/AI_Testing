Score: 0.5000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response correctly identifies the applicant's credit score as a medium severity issue, aligning with the sub-prime (Tier C) band in policy. Other factors such as Debt-to-Income (DTI) and Loan-to-Value (LTV) are highlighted but incorrectly assigned higher severity than necessary; LTV and DTI are well within policy limits and should have been flagged as low severity, not medium. There is also a hallucinated critical flag for a missing credit report, which should not be penalized per steps. The response does not identify any major discrepancies or create information outside the input data beyond the expected model error, but it inaccurately elevates certain minor findings. This results in partial alignment with the expected output.
