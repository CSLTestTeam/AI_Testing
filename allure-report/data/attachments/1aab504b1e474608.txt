Reasoning: The response identifies several issues in the triage and delivers a detailed policy-based reasoning, including the applicant's credit score, debt-to-income, loan to value, and vehicle age versus loan term. However, it does not correctly highlight that the maximum permitted loan term for Tier C applicants is 60 months as required by policy Section 4.3. Instead, it incorrectly places the emphasis on vehicle age-related loan term limits (48 months for vehicles over 5 years old), when the vehicle is only 4 years old at purchase. There are also duplicate and contradictory flags about the loan-to-value ratio (some label it as exceeding and others as compliant), indicating confusion and lack of focus. No hallucinations are present except for the missing credit report, which must not be penalised. Overall, the key expected policy finding (term >60 months for Tier C) is missing, leading to significant deduction.
