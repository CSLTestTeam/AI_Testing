Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output incorrectly claims that the credit report is missing, despite the input providing a detailed credit report. This constitutes a significant hallucination as the output makes multiple findings, flags, and reasonings based on the supposed absence of the credit report, which is not true. Other findings, such as the applicant being underage and the correct calculation of Loan-to-Value ratio, are accurate and faithful to the input data with no calculation errors. However, because the response is based on a false premise about missing information (except for the credit report, which should not have been flagged), its overall faithfulness and reliability are substantially compromised.
