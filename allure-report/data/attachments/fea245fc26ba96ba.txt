Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response misses a key required finding: it does not flag or mention that the DTI ratio exceeds the maximum allowed for Tier C applicants as required by policy. The review demonstrates a systematic approach, referencing income, loan amount, and vehicle details, but it neglects to calculate or analyze DTI despite clear instructions, and does not report this as an issue. There are no major hallucinations aside from repeated discussion of the missing credit report, which is not penalized. However, failure to highlight the policy breach results in significant loss of alignment with requirements.
