    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n- **Observation:** The credit report is missing for this application, making it impossible to perform the required analyses regarding the applicant's financial health, historical behavior, and any warnings for fraudulent activity. This has been marked as a Critical finding.\n\nAs the credit report is not available, I will now proceed to Step 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- There do not appear to be any immediate “smell test” failures based on the data provided. The applicant has a relatively low credit score of 560, but without a detailed credit report, it is challenging to validate this metric further or contextualize it against the applicant’s broader financial behavior. The details regarding the loan structure, income, and vehicle price appear reasonable and aligned. No findings here. Proceeding to Step 3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nTo perform a comprehensive policy checks, I will retrieve all the specific policy sections related to:\n**3a. Credit Tiers**, **3b. Vehicle Criteria and LTV**, and **3c. DTI thresholds.**### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n#### Credit Risk\n1. **Credit Score Below Tier Minimum**\n   - **Issue:** The applicant's credit score of **560** places them under Credit Tier C (Sub-Prime), which requires stricter lending terms.\n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 2.1 of the underwriting manual specifies that Tier C involves a score range of 550-619 and stricter criteria.\n   - **Action:** Reported as a **Medium** severity finding.\n\n#### Asset and Loan Structure\n2. **Excessive Vehicle Mileage**\n   - **Issue:** The vehicle's mileage of **148,024 miles** exceeds the maximum allowable limit of **100,000 miles** as per policy requirements.\n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 4.2 indicates that vehicles exceeding the mileage cap are ineligible for finance.\n   - **Action:** Reported as a **High** severity finding.\n\n3. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**\n   - **Issue:** The LTV ratio was calculated at **67.97%**, which is below the Tier C maximum threshold of **95%** but still requires monitoring due to the applicant's credit risk.\n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 4.1 allows a maximum LTV ratio of 95% for Tier C applicants.\n   - **Action:** Reported as a **Low** severity finding.\n\n#### Affordability Assessment\n4. **Low Debt-to-Income Ratio**\n   - **Issue:** The DTI ratio was calculated at **2%**, which is well below the maximum allowed threshold of **35%** for Tier C applicants.\n   - **Policy Reference:** Section 3.1 specifies the maximum allowable DTI of 35%.\n   - **Action:** Reported as a **Low** severity finding.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nCombining findings:\n- The **credit score violation**, **vehicle mileage issue**, and the **absence of a credit report** collectively represent significant risk factors, despite a low DTI and compliant LTV.\n- The extraordinary mileage of the vehicle exacerbates concerns about the collateral’s value and the applicant's repayment capability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n1. I identified critical issues with the proposal:\n   - A missing credit report (**Critical** finding).\n   - An ineligible vehicle due to excessive mileage (**High** finding).\n   - Credit score below Tier C minimum (**Medium** finding).\n2. While the LTV and DTI metrics are within acceptable ranges, they do not sufficiently mitigate the risks associated with the other critical and high findings.\n3. The absence of the credit report is a major impediment to conducting a detailed risk assessment, including validating the credit score and checking for fraud flags.\n\n### Recommended Action\n- The absence of the credit report, excessive mileage of the vehicle, and low credit score cumulatively suggest that the proposal is unfinanceable under current conditions. Immediate rejection or significant re-structuring of the deal would be necessary.\n\n**Final Phrase:** TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
