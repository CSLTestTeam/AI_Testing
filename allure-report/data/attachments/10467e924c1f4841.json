    ],
    "reasoning": "### Steps Taken and Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Data Verification:**\n   - This step was skipped as the credit report was unavailable. Recorded a critical finding for the absence of the credit report since financial health and validation couldn't be determined.\n   \n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- Reviewed the proposal and based on an overall evaluation of the available data:\n  - The loan amount appears reasonable relative to the applicant's stated income and the value of the vehicle.\n  - No red flags were apparent at this stage, apart from the insufficient credit report information.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Risk Analysis:**\n   - Retrieved the \"Credit Tiers\" policy. Verified that the applicant's credit score (600) placed them in Tier C, which imposes additional lending requirements. A medium-severity finding was reported for the sub-prime credit score.\n\n2. **Vehicle and Loan Analysis:**\n   - The vehicle age of 3 years and projected age of 8 years at the conclusion of the 60-month term complies with the maximum allowed age policy. A low-severity finding was logged to clarify.\n   - The vehicle mileage (48,024 miles) is below the maximum allowed 100,000 miles at the start of the agreement, aligning with policy conditions. This was noted as a low-severity finding.\n   - The loan term (60 months) is at the policy's upper limit. Flagged as a low-severity finding for careful consideration.\n   - Conducted an LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio calculation using: **(Advance/Trade Price) * 100 = (27,381 / 40,283) * 100 = 67.97%**. This value complies with the maximum allowed LTV of 95% for Tier C applicants, which was flagged as a low-severity finding.\n\n3. **Affordability Analysis:**\n   - Retrieved the \"DTI Thresholds\" section. Used the Debt-to-Income ratio formula to calculate DTI. Since there are no existing financial commitments, the ratio was very low: **(400 / 20,292) * 100 = 2%**. Maximum allowable for Tier C applicants is 35%. Reported this as a low-severity finding.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- Overall, the critical issue with the missing credit report poses a significant risk in properly assessing the applicant's financial health.\n- The calculated metrics like LTV (67.97%) and DTI (2%) both fall well within acceptable limits, and the vehicle satisfies age and mileage requirements.\n- However, the combination of sub-prime credit (Tier C) and maximum loan term warrants caution.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis proposal is heavily hindered by the critical absence of a credit report (Critical Finding). While no major issues exist when evaluating the available metrics, they cannot fully compensate for the inability to assess the applicant's credit health. Additional concerns, including the sub-prime credit score (Medium Finding), reinforce the need for careful consideration before proceeding with this application. Strong elements like the low DTI and LTV ratios suggest potential mitigants.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
