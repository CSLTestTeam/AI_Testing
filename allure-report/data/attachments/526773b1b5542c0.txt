Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output correctly reports three issues related to income verification, loan-to-value ratio, and the missing credit report and does not penalise the absence of the credit report as required. However, it fails to report a mandatory policy violation: the vehicle will be 13 years old at the end of the loan, exceeding the 12-year maximum. The reasoning mentions this age violation but does not report it as a triage flag with full details (severity, target field, current and expected value, recommendation, etc.), which is required by the reporting process outlined in the retrieval context. There are no false mismatches highlighted. Other steps are mostly followed, but failure to triage the vehicle age policy breach is a notable shortcoming that lowers the alignment.
