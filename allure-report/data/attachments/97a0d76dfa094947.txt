Score: 0.8000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response faithfully flags the high vehicle mileage, accurately categorizing it as a high-severity issue and citing the relevant policy limit of 100,000 miles versus the actual 148,024 miles. It does not invent any issues apart from those expected, nor does it misinterpret the input facts. All findings except the missing credit report are grounded in the input data. Minor extraneous detail about income validation and other low-severity risks is present, but these do not constitute hallucinations. The mention of the high mileage directly aligns with the expected output.
