    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification and Credit Analysis\nSkipping this step due to unavailability of the credit report, but a **critical finding** has been reported.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n\nThe stated monthly income of £20,292 appears exceedingly high for a \"Technical Lead\" role, especially for someone employed for just 7 months. While not entirely implausible, this value is highly unusual and could necessitate additional income verification. A **high-severity finding** has been reported.\n\nAssessment of loan amount: The advance amount stands at £27,381 and makes sense relative to the retail price (£42,757), given the deposit of £15,376. However, the high income discrepancy raises concerns about the affordability of repayments without proper validation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\nBased on the available submitted credit score (550):\n- This places the applicant in **Tier C (Sub-Prime)**, just meeting this tier.\n- Tier D (Below 550) would result in automatic decline unless exceptional circumstances exist.\n  \nThe applicant's credit score meets the minimal criterion for Tier C and does not automatically warrant denial, but inherent risk is heightened in this segment.\n\n---\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure\n\nPerformed calculations and checked policies:\n1. **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):**\n   - The calculated LTV is approximately **67.97%**, above the Tier C LTV maximum of **55%**.\n   - This violates the conditions set under \"Vehicle Criteria and LTV\" (Policy Sec. 4.1).\n   - Documented this as a **medium-severity issue**.\n\n2. **Vehicle Age & Mileage:**\n   - The vehicle is 10 years old now, and will be **13 years old** by the end of the loan term. Policy (Sec. 4.2) only permits vehicles to reach a maximum of 12 years by term's end.\n   - The vehicle mileage is 48,024, within the allowable limit of 100,000 miles.\n\nVerification confirms that the vehicle's age is a **Policy Violation** and makes the proposal *non-compliant*. I'll document this separately.\n\n3. **Term Length:**\n   - At 36 months, the loan term complies with the permitted max of 48 months for aged vehicles, per Policy.\n\n---\n\n#### Affordability (DTI Ratio)\nNet income could not be verified because of necessary PAYE stub requested—Further prudent verifiable-income-policy-viel of Salary ."
