Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response is largely faithful, and matches the input data and most policy rules accurately. It correctly reports the applicant's credit score, LTV ratio, and DTI calculation, and notes the vehicle will be at the maximum allowable age of 12 years at term end. However, the output describes the vehicle age flag as 'will reach the upper allowable age limit at agreement end', recommending a shorter term but does not flag an actual exceedance. According to policy, if the vehicle is exactly at the limit at term end (12 years), this is compliant, but the Expected Output requests an explicit highlight that the vehicle age at agreement end exceeds the policy maximum. The output lacks this clarity and incorrectly treats 12 years as the limit rather than a breach, making this a partial miss. There are no hallucinations except for the ignored missing credit report flag.
