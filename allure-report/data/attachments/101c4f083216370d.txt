Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response identifies the correct credit score tier (Tier C for a score of 560) and properly references relevant policy criteria for DTI, LTV, vehicle age, mileage, term, and deposit. However, most risk flags are set at medium severity for DTI ratio and credit score, while expected output suggests these should be low severity except for the credit score tier. The findings are faithful to the input data with no hallucinations, and all flagged issues are supported by facts from the proposal and policy. The only shortcoming is overly cautious severity ratings for some findings which do not fully align with expected output.
