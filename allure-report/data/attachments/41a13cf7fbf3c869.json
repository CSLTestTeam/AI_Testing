    "reasoning": "### Triage Report Summary\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Data Verification**: Not applicable, as no credit report data was provided for cross-referencing against the proposal.\n    - **Finding**: **Critical** - No credit report was provided, a significant compliance and risk issue that prevents standard analysis.\n2. **Credit Analysis**: Skipped due to the unavailability of the credit report.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe proposal appears logical within its context:\n- Applicant's stated monthly income is high (£20,292). The loan advance (£27,381) represents a reasonable percentage of the vehicle cost (£42,757).\n- No significant red flags at this stage requiring additional findings beyond what was noted in Step 1.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nI conducted a comprehensive review of the proposal against the underwriting manual, as detailed below:\n\n1. **Credit Tiers**\n    - Applicant's stated credit score of 600 qualifies them as **Tier C (Sub-Prime)**. \n    - **Finding**: **Medium** - Stricter underwriting measures and minimum deposit are required as per policy.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**\n    - LTV ratio was calculated: **67.97%**.\n    - Policy limit for Tier C is **≤ 95%**, making the LTV acceptable.\n    - **Finding**: **Medium** - LTV complies with Tier C requirements.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**\n    - DTI ratio was calculated as **2%**, significantly below the maximum allowable for Tier C at **35%**.\n    - **Finding**: **Low** - No affordability concerns due to the low DTI.\n\n4. **Vehicle Criteria**\n    - **Maximum Age at Start**: The vehicle is from 2020, making it 5 years old. Complies with the maximum 8-year limit.\n        - **Finding**: **Low** - Vehicle meets policy requirements for starting age.\n    - **Maximum Age at End**: After a 5-year term, the vehicle will be 10 years old, which is within the 12-year limit. No issues found.\n        - **Finding**: **Low** - Vehicle will comply with age limits at term end.\n    - **Vehicle Mileage**: The vehicle has 48,024 miles recorded, comfortably within the maximum allowed (100,000 miles), as defined by policy.\n        - **Finding**: **Low** - Mileage complies with policy limits.\n\n5. **Loan Term**\n    - Loan term is 60 months, which is the maximum allowable length for any vehicle younger than 5 years at agreement start. Complies with policy Section 4.3.\n        - An explicit finding was not raised for this since no violation or special instructions needed to be flagged.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nIn this case, while all evaluated parameters comply with the Tier C lending criteria as per the policy manual, the lack of a credit report severely impedes the ability to fully assess risk, particularly related to fraud indicators, missed payments, and past defaults. This represents a critical issue that must be addressed before any underwriting decisions.\n\nNo specific risk clusters were identified in this proposal since it complies with LTV, DTI, vehicle criteria, and loan term policies.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe review consisted of a thorough investigation of compliance with policy guidelines regarding credit score, affordability, loan structure, and asset (vehicle) standards. Crucially, however, the absence of a credit report prevents essential risk and data integrity checks.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- This triage uncovered a critical issue (Missing Credit Report). Recommend rejection or immediate resolution of this matter.\n- The proposal otherwise meets Tier C lending criteria, but underwriting cannot proceed until the credit report matter is addressed to enable proper risk analysis.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
