    "reasoning": "### Final Review Summary:\n\n#### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\n1. **Data Verification:** The credit report is marked as \"Not Available,\" which is a critical finding as it inhibits a nuanced assessment of creditworthiness.\n2. **Credit Risk Analysis:** Unable to proceed due to the absence of credit report data.\n\n#### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\n- The credit score, stated income, and the proposed loan terms appear reasonable. However, the lack of credit history details prevents a thorough sanity check.\n\n#### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n1. **Credit Tier Assessment:**\n   - The applicant falls within **Tier B (Near-Prime)** based on a credit score of **665** (Policy Section 2.1).\n   - Action Taken: Verified and flagged this categorization for downstream policy checks.\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV):**\n   - Calculated LTV is **67.97%**, which is **within Tier B's maximum of 100%**.\n   - Action Taken: Marked this as compliant (Policy Section 4.1).\n3. **Debt-to-Income (DTI):**\n   - Calculated DTI is **8%**, which is well within Tier B's threshold of **40%**.\n   - Action Taken: Marked this as compliant (Policy Section 3.1).\n4. **Vehicle Criteria:**\n   - Vehicle will be **13 years old** at the agreement's end, exceeding the allowable maximum of **12 years** (Policy Section 4.2).\n   - **Issue Severity:** Medium; recommend shortening the term.\n   - No issues with the vehicle's age at agreement start or its mileage, both of which meet policy requirements.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- **Critical Gaps:**\n  - Missing credit report data is a significant limitationâ€”this alone prevents a full risk assessment.\n  - Vehicle age breach at the agreement's end is a moderate issue and could be mitigated.\n- **Overall Observations:**\n  - Most aspects (e.g., Tier compliance, LTV, DTI) support a relatively low-risk profile. However, the lack of credit data adds ambiguity, and the vehicle's age breach needs addressing.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclude Review\nAll findings have been systematically reviewed and flagged.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
