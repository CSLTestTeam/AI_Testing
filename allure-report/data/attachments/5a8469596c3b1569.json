No issues.\n     - Severity: Low.\n   - **Vehicle's Age**:\n     - At start of agreement: 6 years old, meets the maximum allowable age at the time of finance (8 years max).\n       - Severity: Low.\n     - At end of term: 10 years old, within the 12-year maximum policy.\n       - Severity: Low.\n   - **Mileage**: Vehicle mileage at 48,024 miles complies with policy limit (≤ 100,000 miles at the start of agreement).\n     - Severity: Low.\n\n3. **Affordability**:\n   - **DTI Ratio**: 8%, calculated from the provided financial structure, which is significantly below the maximum 40% allowance for Tier B applicants.\n     - Severity: Low.\n\n#### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\n- Despite the applicant being in Tier B, combined factors (low LTV, very low DTI, and compliance with vehicle criteria) suggest manageable risk levels. However, the unavailability of a credit report remains a critical barrier.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclude\nThis review was conducted systematically. All findings related to the missing credit report, affordability, LTV, and vehicle eligibility were reported. Key concerns were identified, particularly the absence of a credit report which critically hampers risk assessment.\n\n**TRIAGE_COMPLETE**"
