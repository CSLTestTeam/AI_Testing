Score: 0.2000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output hallucinates a missing credit report, even though the input provides a fully detailed credit report. All triage flags and reasoning based on the absence of a credit report are incorrect and not supported by the input data. However, the rest of the findings regarding credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and debt-to-income ratio are generally accurate and match the provided input values. The response fails to perform a methodical review of the credit report data but does not invent other unrelated details.
