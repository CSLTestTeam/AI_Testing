    "reasoning": "### **Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis**\n\nThe provided credit report does not contain any data as it explicitly states that no credit report is available. This is a **critical issue** because the lack of a credit report means we cannot complete the requisite credit risk analysis. I have reported this issue as described.\n\nSince no credit information is provided, steps 1a (Verify Data Integrity) and 1b (Analyze Credit Risk) are skipped entirely.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Initial Sanity Check**\n\nI will now perform a basic plausibility analysis of the proposal data.\n\n1. **Nature of the Proposal**: The applicant's stated monthly income is £20,292, and the combined cost of the deal's advance (£27,381) and deposit (£15,376) suggests affordability relative to income is plausible. Additionally, purchasing a car valued at £42,757 may align with this income figure.\n\n2. **Income and Employment**: The applicant's recent employment at 7 months might be considered risky without additional stability in tenure. This will require further analysis against policy.\n\nNo immediate \"smell test\" failures are identified, but the findings might shift as details from policy searches are considered.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification**\n\nThis section involves systematically verifying the components of the proposal against specific underwriting policies.\n\n#### **3a. Credit Risk**\n\nSince the credit report is unavailable, noting that an analysis of the credit score tiers against policy is not feasible, hence no further steps can be performed for credit risk evaluation here.\n\n#### **3b. Asset & Loan Structure**\n\n1. **Vehicle Age and Mileage**\n   - Requested vehicle is a 2019 Honda Jazz with 48,024 miles.\n   - Querying the policy manual for vehicle eligibility criteria.\n\n2. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**\n   - Loan advance: £27,381\n   - Vehicle trade price: £40,283\n   - Calculating the LTV ratio and verifying against the policy.\n\n3. **Loan Term**\n   - Term requested is 36 months.\n   - Querying the policy manual for the permissible loan duration.\n\n---\n\n#### **3c. Affordability**\n\n1. **Compute Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**\n   - Applicant has a monthly income of £20,292. Monthly instalment is £400.\n   - No other financial commitments are specified, assuming £0 for total monthly commitments unless otherwise noted.\n   - Calculating DTI ratio and verifying against relevant policy.\n\nQuerying the relevant policy rules and initiating the necessary calculations.### Step 3b: Asset & Loan Structure Findings\n\n#### Vehicle Age and Mileage\n- **Policy**: The maximum allowed vehicle age at the start of the agreement is 8 years, and at the end of the term it is 12 years. The vehicle's mileage must not exceed 100,000.\n- **Analysis**: The Honda Jazz is a 2019 model, making it 6 years old at the start of the agreement. With a term of 36 months (3 years), the vehicle would be 9 years old at the end of the term. The odometer reads 48,024 miles, which is under the limit of 100,000 miles.\n- **Conclusion**: The vehicle satisfies age and mileage requirements.\n\n#### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio\n- **Policy**: For Tier C (credit score between 550 and 619), the maximum allowed LTV is 95%.\n- **Calculated LTV**: 67.97%\n- **Conclusion**: The requested LTV of 67.97% is well below the 95% maximum.\n\n#### Loan Term\n- **Policy**: For vehicles older than 5 years, the maximum loan term allowed is 48 months. \n- **Analysis**: With the vehicle being 6 years old, the proposed loan term of 36 months does not exceed the maximum stipulation (48 months).\n- **Conclusion**: The loan term is compliant.\n\n### Step 3c: Affordability Analysis\n\n#### Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio\n- **Policy**: For Tier C applicants, the maximum allowable DTI is 35%.\n- **Calculated DTI**: 2.0% (based on a monthly commitment of £400 and a net monthly income of £20,292).\n- **Conclusion**: The DTI ratio is significantly under the allowed limit of 35%.\n\n---\n\n### Reporting Findings\nI will now report the findings for the issues identified during Step 3.### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis and Observations\n\nCombining the individual findings:\n\n- The applicant’s LTV, vehicle age, mileage, and loan term are all compliant with policy.\n- The debt-to-income ratio is extremely low, indicating excellent affordability for the proposed loan.\n- The critical issue remains the unavailability of the credit report. This prevents the assessment of the applicant's creditworthiness and other key risk factors (e.g., payment history, defaults, fraud alerts).\n\n### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n1. **Critical Finding**: The absence of a credit report is a significant barrier to determining the applicant's overall credit risk. It is essential to obtain the credit report to evaluate their financial behavior and credit history. Without this, the application is incomplete and cannot be processed further.\n\n2. **Recommendation**: The underwriter should contact the customer or their financial institution immediately to resolve this issue. Only upon receiving a valid credit report should the proposal be considered for further action.\n\n3. **Secondary Observations**: While all scrutinized proposal aspects comply with company policy, reassessment would be required upon receiving the credit report to confirm the applicant's creditworthiness and risk tier.\n\n---\n\n**Final Statement:** TRIAGE_COMPLETE"
