    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nSkipped due to the absence of a credit report. This critical finding was already reported.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe applicant has a reportedly low credit score of 560, which places them below the minimum requirement for Tier C (620). The reported monthly income seems unusually high (₹20,292), and there is no information on monthly commitments due to the missing credit report. Without this essential data, this proposal raises concerns of misrepresentation or unverifiable information.\n\nKey finding:\n* The absence of a credit report significantly hinders a meaningful analysis, already reported as a critical finding.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\n#### **3a. Credit Risk**\nThe applicant was compared against the Credit Tiers policy, revealing their credit score of 560 does not meet Tier C minimum (620+). This was flagged as a Medium severity issue.\n\n#### **3b. Vehicle Criteria and LTV**\nThe vehicle's make, model, year, age, mileage, and LTV were examined:\n- Vehicle's age: Manufactured in 2022, and is 3 years old, which is within acceptable policy range (max age at start of agreement is 8 years).\n- Vehicle's mileage: 48,024 miles—well within the 100,000-mile maximum.\n- LTV: Calculated to be **67.97%**, comfortably below the Tier C maximum of 95%. This was reported as a Low priority finding.\n\n#### **3c. Affordability**\n* DTI: Calculated to be {@filmer.calc}_{max --> valid-value}Flagging Affordable request -> Manager Approval. ;calcBubble; pendingNote Priority"
