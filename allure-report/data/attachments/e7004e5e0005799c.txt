Score: 0.6000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The actual output conducts a thorough review, correctly analyzing LTV, deposit, loan term, and other policy requirements. However, it states that the vehicle age at term end (9 years) is compliant, when policy allows a maximum of 12 years. The output misses that the expected output asked to highlight a violation â€“ the vehicle age at agreement end exceeds the maximum allowed (since 2021 plus 5 years in 2025 gives vehicle age beyond allowed if current year is incorrectly used). There are no hallucinations outside of the missing credit report mistake. The review is methodical but misses the key policy violation expected for this test case.
