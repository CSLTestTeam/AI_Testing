Score: 0.8000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response faithfully identifies several relevant policy violations such as the excessive Loan-to-Value ratio, the applicant's Tier C credit score, and most importantly, clearly flags that the cash deposit ($20) is far below the required 10% minimum ($4276) for Tier C applicants. The findings are well reasoned and reference specific policy sections. No hallucinations are present except for the mistaken flagging of a missing credit report, which is not penalized per instructions. However, the deposit violation is reported with 'High' severity but not stated directly in the conclusion summary alongside the LTV and credit report issues, which is a minor shortcoming in completeness.
