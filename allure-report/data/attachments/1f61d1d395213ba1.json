    "reasoning": "### Step 1: Data Verification & Credit Analysis\nThe critical issue identified during this step is the absence of a credit report for the applicant, which compromises the underwriting process. Without this data, it's impossible to verify financial history, identify fraud markers, or fully evaluate creditworthiness. A \"Critical\" severity finding was reported.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Sanity Check\nThe applicant's stated monthly income of £20,292 raises concerns about plausibility given their job title, \"Technical Lead,\" and a short employment duration of 7 months at the current position. However, without a credit report and supporting documents (e.g., payslips), this cannot be substantiated.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Policy Verification\nSubsequently, I systematically compared the proposal against the underwriting policy rules for credit score, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and vehicle criteria. All findings have been reported below:\n\n#### 3a. Credit Risk\n- **Credit Score:** The applicant's score of 574 is in the Tier C (Sub-Prime) range (550-619), which complies with the policy but requires enhanced scrutiny. A \"High\" finding for this was reported, and strict compliance with secondary policies, such as minimum deposit requirements, is necessary.\n\n#### 3b. Asset & Loan Structure\n- **Loan-to-Value Ratio:** The calculated LTV ratio is approximately 67.97%, which complies with the Tier C maximum of 95%. This compliance was reported as a low-severity point of information.\n- **Vehicle Age:** The vehicle is 8 years old as of the agreement's start and will reach the allowable limit of 12 years by the agreement term's conclusion. This was flagged as a \"Medium\" severity risk for review.\n- **Loan Term:** The proposed term of 60 months is acceptable for vehicles up to 8 years old, as per policy.\n\n#### 3c. Affordability\n- **Debt-to-Income Ratio:** The calculated DTI ratio is 2%, well within the allowable 35% limit for Tier C applicants. This was reported as a low-severity point of information.\n\n### Step 4: Holistic Synthesis\nThe combination of a critically low credit score (Tier C) and the vehicle age pushing the allowable limit at the end of the loan term creates a moderate risk. While the applicant qualifies based on individual criteria like LTV and DTI ratios, they might face future challenges if their financial circumstances change.\n\n### Summary of Reported Findings\n1. **Critical:** Missing credit report. No financial history can currently be verified, which severely impacts the ability to judge creditworthiness.\n2. **High:** The credit score of 574 barely meets the Tier C classification, requiring augmented compliance with stricter underwriting policies.\n3. **Low:** Acceptable LTV of 67.97%, within the policy's maximum threshold of 95% for Tier C.\n4. **Low:** Acceptable DTI ratio of 2%, well below the 35% threshold for Tier C.\n5. **Medium:** Vehicle age will reach the maximum allowable limit of 12 years by the end of the loan term, leaving no margin for error if term adjustments or extensions occur. A recommendation to consider a shorter loan term was provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe credit report's absence is critical and must be resolved before any further progress. While the application meets specific criteria such as the LTV and DTI ratios, the low credit score and vehicle age nearing its limit suggest the need for caution. Without additional financial validation documents, such as a current payslip or bank statements, it is impossible to proceed with confidence. Recommendations include withholding approval until a credit report is provided and re-evaluating the loan term.\n\nTRIAGE_COMPLETE"
