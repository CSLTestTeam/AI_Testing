Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response follows the retrieval context step-by-step: issues are reported using the correct format, relevant fields, values, and policy expectations are explicitly cited. All findings for credit score, vehicle age, mileage, loan term, LTV, and DTI are correctly flagged with accurate severity, reasoning, and tied to policy sections. The synthesis and conclusion reference risk factors and follow the mandated structure, ending with 'TRIAGE_COMPLETE'. However, the output falsely flags a missing credit report as a 'Critical' finding, even though a detailed credit report is present in the input. This is a significant false mismatch that should have been avoided, reducing the score. Otherwise, the output is systematic, clear, and comprehensive.
