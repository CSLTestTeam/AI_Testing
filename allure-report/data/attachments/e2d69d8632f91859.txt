Score: 0.7000
Status: PASS
Reasoning: The response covers most required steps, citing policy rules and applying calculations. It reports findings for credit score, loan term, and LTV, but it incorrectly raises a critical issue about a missing credit report, despite a full report being present in the input (however, this is not penalised). It does not flag any false mismatches in applicant data, but it misses some details: the cash deposit threshold for Tier C applicants (minimum 10%) under policy section 4.4 is not checked or flagged, and the findings around vehicle age at term end are ambiguousâ€”the vehicle reaches, but does not exceed, the 12-year maximum, which should not be a violation. The review is methodical and mostly aligns with the retrieval context, but fails to report all required findings.
