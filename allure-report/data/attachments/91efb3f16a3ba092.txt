Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response is comprehensive and covers policy verification, correctly identifying compliance with most criteria; however, it fails to flag a key issue from the expected output: the maximum term for vehicles over 5 years old should be restricted to 48 months, while the proposal's term is 60 months. This oversight means a significant policy violation was missed, diminishing the faithfulness and completeness of the output.
