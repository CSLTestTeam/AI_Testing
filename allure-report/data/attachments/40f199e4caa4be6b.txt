Score: 0.2000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output contains a major hallucination: it repeatedly claims that no credit report was provided and bases its triage on this false premise. In reality, the input includes a detailed credit report for the applicant, with relevant data such as credit score, account summaries, addresses, and more. While the rest of the findings, such as the flagged date of birth error, credit score tier assignment, and correct calculations of LTV and DTI using input data, are faithful and accurate, the fundamental oversight regarding the credit report dominates the logic and reasoning. As per the evaluation steps, the missing credit report and consequences should NOT be penalised, but other than this error, the analysis does not hallucinate additional data and the calculations align with the input. Minor deductions are made for failure to acknowledge or use the available credit report data for a more comprehensive risk analysis, but no further hallucinations or unsupported claims are present.
