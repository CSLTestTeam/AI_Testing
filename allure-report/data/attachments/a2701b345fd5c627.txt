Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output critically misrepresents the input by claiming the credit report is missing, whereas a detailed credit report is present in the input. This is a significant hallucination and shows a lack of faithfulness to the data provided. Apart from this error, the rest of the findings (credit score tier, LTV, DTI, vehicle age/mileage) are accurately matched to the input values and policy thresholds. Calculation of ratios and reasonings are logical based on the input. However, the major issue is the fabricated absence of a credit report, which per evaluation steps should not be penalized, but the score must reflect that this is the only hallucination present and the rest is sound.
