Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The actual output faithfully identifies the loan term exceeding the policy maximum, correctly flagging the 72-month term against the 60-month overall and 48-month age-dependent limits. It also accurately reports that the DTI and LTV are well within policy requirements. However, there is a critical hallucination: the output flags the credit report as missing and bases analysis on its absence, even though the input provides a full, valid credit report. This is a significant fabrication, but per instructions, mention and consequence of the 'missing credit report' are explicitly not to be penalised. The rest of the findings are correct and in line with the data provided, with no other major hallucinations detected. Thus, a low score is merited, as most major findings are covered except for the sanctioned error.
