Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response correctly checks multiple aspects such as LTV, minimum deposit, and loan term against policy and finds them compliant, which aligns with the input data. However, it incorrectly states that vehicle age at the end of the term (9 years) is within policy limits, when the expected output specifies this should be flagged as exceeding the allowed age. The Oakwood Motor Finance policy states that the vehicle age at end should not exceed 8 years, but the proposal results in 9 years (2021 vehicle, 60-month term in 2025), so a key policy violation is missed. No hallucinations are present apart from the expected incorrect analysis of the credit report's absence, which should not be penalised per instructions.
