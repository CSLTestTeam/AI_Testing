Score: 0.3000
Status: FAIL
Reasoning: The response accurately identifies and flags several policy violations present in the input, including correctly noting the applicant's credit score being below the Tier C minimum, the excessive loan term beyond the policy maximum, and both the LTV and DTI calculations. However, there are notable hallucinations and duplications: it repeatedly flags the Loan-to-Value ratio as both compliant and exceeding policy (despite the value being well within policy limits), and critically misstates the absence of a credit report, which is actually provided in the input. It also incorrectly claims the Honda Jazzâ€™s age at term end would breach the 12-year maximum (the vehicle would be 10 years old after 72 months). These inaccuracies indicate only partial faithfulness to the input data and policy requirements.
